      "0 The article examines the role of silence in learners’ language development by discussing current theories in second language acquisition and by connecting them to the silence phenomenon. A number of important constructs in SLA are brought up as they have potential to be associated with the silent mode of learning, namely the silent period, input, output, communicative competence, among others. The discussion also highlights a few theoretical gaps in SLA discourse that are related to silence. Classroom-based research has flourished in the past 15 years, often introduced institutionally, as part of teachers’ Continuous Professional Development. Supporting teachers in their classroom research requires facilitation and scaffolding. Therefore, teacher trainers are often assigned the tasks of research-mentoring. However, this activity requires special skills and sustained mentoring of the mentors themselves. Mentoring, as an activity, has a rich literature, but mentoring teachers, and more specifically, mentoring language teachers researching their classrooms has not been widely documented as yet. The present self-study constitutes a reflective account of an experienced teacher trainer’s journey into mentoring. By simultaneously taking part in an online mentoring course as well as putting the newly gained knowledge into practice, the author was able to mentor 11 English language teachers and 5 English major students that came together to carry out tasks related to mentoring action research projects and / or accomplish their own classroom research as required by the Ecuadorian state university where they teach or study. The self-study draws on the first three months of the year-long program, and presents the process of growing into the mentoring role by using the author’s reflective journal, email exchanges with her lead-mentor, posts on the online EVO Mentoring course and feedback from participants. The author concludes that mentoring teacher-researchers is a two-way activity that benefits both the mentor and the mentee, but the value of mentoring should be acknowledged institutionally, and its practice extended. Many international students enroll in yearlong Intensive English Programs (IEP) in English-speaking countries in the hope of acquiring the language proficiency necessary for academic study. Nation (2006) estimatedthatthese students need to know between 8,000 and 10,000 of the most commonly used word families in English to havegood comprehension of adult-level texts. There is considerable evidence, however, that reading for pleasureis at least as effective as formal study inboosting vocabulary knowledge (Krashen, 2004), including academic vocabulary (McQuillan, 2019). This study was designed to explore English language teachers’ understanding of task-based language teaching and their practices of designing tasks for teaching writing. In the first part, I discuss the concept of task-based language teaching, tasks, and task design connecting with my experiences within the framework of the socio-cultural approach to second language acquisition. I used both unstructured and semi-structured interview questions to explore the lived experiences of secondary level English teachers of community schools of Nawalparasi district in Nepal. The study reveals mixed responses of participants in understanding task-based teaching and language tasks though they held positive perceptions toward the phenomenon. The findings suggest that teachers design tasks incorporating textual exercises as well as their (both students and teachers) experiential life events for teaching writing according to their students’ level, need, and interest for teaching writing. The study further reveals that teachers design both different tasks to address the diverse learning abilities of the students. However, the findings also show that more exposure is needed to enable teachers to design more suitable tasks for teaching writing. The hypothesis explored in this paper is whether a “virtuous circle” can be established to promote English language development: providing access to interesting and comprehensible reading material, which in turn will increase reading English books, which in turn will promote English competence and in turn more reading of English books. Specifically, we seek to determine if those with more access to English books at home and through visits to bookstores show more interest in reading, and in turn are more supportive of having an English library at their school. Analysis of responses of sixth graders at four schools in Korea revealed little access to English reading material, but supported the virtuous circle hypothesis, suggesting that the path to high English competence may be easier to establish than we have imagined. Exploring a language learning history can help researchers, teachers, and students to reveal and understand various individual difference factors which positively or negatively influence language learning activities and strategy use. In this paper, I examined my English language learning history and delved into challenges and factors to overcome them and activate my autonomy. Based on the analysis of my learning history, three main themes were indicated: a) motivational shifts and goal-setting theory, b) learning beliefs and goal setting, and c) the relationship between learning strategy use and teachers’ influence. Furthermore, my learning history also illustrated that I tended to change all these features through both successful and unsuccessful experiences. Among them, goal-setting seems to be the most significant factor for me to study the target language. With clear learning objectives, I overcame many challenges and sustained high motivation by utilising various types of learning strategies and having positive learner beliefs. Accordingly, noticeable relationships among motivation, learner belief, and learning strategy use were revealed through my learning history log. With the amount of empirical evidence available to prove the benefits of Extensive Reading (ER) for the development of language proficiency and literacy, those outside the teaching fraternity would think that language teachers and schools would be scrambling to embrace and adopt ER. This is not what I have experienced in a number of primary and secondary schools, including the institution that I am currently teaching. From my own experience as an avid reader and the research papers I have read, I am convinced of the magic of ER. This paper described the process and challenges in planning and developing ER through a 15-minute Silent Reading Programme (15-min SRP) that was carried out in a class of 18 pre-university students and preliminary findings on students’ perceptions towards the implementation of the programme. The paper concluded with recommendations that can help other ER start-ups especially schools in Malaysia. Professional development is an integral aspect of a teacher’s professional life. Effective professional development activities enable teachers, among others, to update and enhance their pedagogical knowledge and skills, and allow teachers to be creative and critical in their teaching approach. But the question is, to what extent the professional development activities and programmes satisfy the teachers’ needs? This nationwide study aims to determine and identify the level of the Malaysian English language teachers’ level of satisfaction of their professional development – whether English language teachers are satisfied with the professional development experiences and opportunities that are provided by the Ministry of Education and the respective State Education Departments. Schools were randomly chosen and the questionnaires were mailed to the headmasters and principals of the schools to be distributed to all English teachers. A total of 2586 (1038 secondary teachers and 1548 primary teachers) questionnaires were received from teachers all over Malaysia. This paper will highlight and discuss the main findings, and provide some critical implications and suggestions in terms of teacher education and planning and implementation of future professional development activities. Currently, how English is being used as a lingua franca (ELF) has caused linguistic and cultural norms to be revisited in relation to language use. The issue of global citizenship has emerged when English is used as the main medium of instruction in higher education; as achieving global citizenship is a main goal of international universities, the ELF paradigm has assisted in the realization of this goal because English is used in a fluid and dynamic perspective. This paper uses interview data (N=6), which was collected from Chinese students from the Chaoshan area who obtained their master’s degrees abroad, to analyze how these students developed their senses of global citizenship. Although their ELF experiences play an important role in understanding global citizenship, many did not receive a formal education regarding global citizenship at home or abroad. This paper concludes by emphasizing how the ELF paradigm can aid higher education institutions raise people’s awareness of global citizenship. The study explores English language teachers’ perspectives and practices of formative assessment. In order to achieve the objective, the qualitative research design was used. I adopted the interpretive research paradigm and the qualitative phenomenological research method to bring the lived experiences of the participants. Four teachers from two campuses of Rupandehi were purposively selected as the research participants. The semi-structured interview and open-ended questions were used in order to draw out information from them. The study was carried out within the theoretical framework of constructivism theory. This study reveals English teachers’ good perspectives and practices of formative assessment as they are aware of the value, purposes, and various types of formative assessment. Since their perspective is clear, they use it to improve student\\'s weaknesses, modify their existing practices, and bring desirable changes in time. However, in practice, teachers do not implement all forms of formative assessment to engage students due to their inadequate practical knowledge, time constraints, and large classrooms. Settling in a new region may imply a plethora of challenges for Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) and for any migrant or immigrant, no matter their background. Such challenges are as diverse as the individuals and their nationalities. Some SIFE have common experiences as immigrants relocating to a new country of residence, regardless of the status of migration. The range of constraints and situations that impact students’ access to formal education and/or its continuity in host countries is broad and deserves our attention as teachers and researchers. In this sense, the analysis of interviews conducted with SIFE from different universities and host countries has led to the consideration of particular difficult situations such as the reasons that pushed them to interrupt their studies and how it has impacted them personally, their access to employment, language, and home country return expectations. Taking into account the value of SIFE ́s own testimony obtained by means of interviews, this article addresses some of the diverse challenges they face in their host countries to raise awareness of the similarities and differences of their experiences, to promote socio-political advocacy for their needs, and to offer ELT educators ways in which they can respond to these special learners’ needs. It also in part can inform socio-political advocacy for SIFE who remain in their home countries of origin, as they often confront similar challenges as the local, regional or national context has been altered so much that they may also be in a context without adequate support.\n",
      "1 The philosophies of Taoism and Confucianism based themselves on primitive Chinese thought. Chinese philosophy arose during an era of leisure, when priorities were other than ours. But we are all equal under the skin and hence what touched the human heart three thousand years ago continues to touch it today, and what touches the heart of a Chinese also touches the heart of a Westerner. What changes is the how we manage joy, but in particular, how we handle anguish and sadness. In sum, what makes us diff erent is the way we understand life and our capacity to enjoy it. This paper is an inductive study with a prescient intention to anticipate the potential economic problems that Equatorial Guinea may face in the coming years. The analysis therefore relates the past (economic crisis due to having agriculture as the only economic foundation) and the present (with an essentially oil-bearing economy) to predict an unexpected future. It shows that, as the current economy is presented with a univocal foundation, it leaves no room but for an economic and social crisis; in other words, the hydrocarbon monopoly, predestines the country to the Dutch disease. This paper describes some educational experiences and ideas suggested by Dewey, Tao, The Work Study Movement and Mao in China between the beginning of the twentieth Century and 1919 as evidence of the implementation of productive work in formal education. Based on the analysis of the active role of ideas in institutional conformation, an ideological divergence between these experiences and ideas, and the “Half Work, Half Study” Educational System (HWHSES) implemented in 1958 in China The article aims to analyze the international relations between China and LatinAmerica under a theoretical profle. This is because the models of internationalrelations that until now have interpreted the world are European or North American. However, both Asia and Latin America are looking for other paradigms to decline global phenomena. This analysis seeks to find common grounds between Chinese and Latin American international relations, through the deepening of new semantic expressions that manifest a concrete change towards the construction of a new international order from the South This article analyzes the state of the hypothetical issue of reunification of the Korean peninsula, studying the possible scenarios, discarding those most improbable and valuing the positive choices and the difficult aspects involved in an evolutionary voluntary reunification or the maintenance of the status quo of two independent States in mutual cooperation or federal or a confederal model; in order to avoid a position contrary to the process, especially from North Korea. The Kenyan general elections of 2017 registered a marked improvement from the 2013 elections in the number of women elected to serve in diﬀerent capacities. The elections saw the first ever women governors and senators emerge victorious from positions that were previously held by men only in 2013. This paper attempts to understand the grammar of patriarchy that stands in the way of women participation and engagement with elections. Drawing examples from recent events, the research argues that cultural traditions and the attendant stereotypes as well as the media perpetuate the patriarchal discourse that will have an overall eﬀect on participation of women in politics. The Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was promulgated in 1968 in order to restrain the worldwide growth of atomic arsenals. Their dispositions have been criticized as offering privileges to the nuclear powers. In addition, the passivity demonstrated by the UN at the time of sanctioning the programs of nuclear weapons of India, Pakistan and Israel, whereas, on the other hand, it penalizes rigorously to Iraq, Iran and North Korea, has been perceived like a slanted application of the Treaty. These contradictions have debilitated its legitimacy and its effectiveness in the achievement of the aim of global nuclear disarmament. This works examines the historic antecedents of the abolition of slavery in Venezuela in two parts: 1) The impact of Haiti’s independence on Latin American and Caribbean colonies. 2) Francisco de Miranda’s trajectory as Precursor of our emancipation; his opinions with regard to the Haitian revolution, and the help its leaders offered him in 1806. It underlines the contradiction between the impact of Haiti´s independence and the help he received, on the one hand, and his racist and pro-slavery feelings as revealed by the author, on the other In this article the main lines of thought of José Manuel Briceño Guerrero regarding LatinAmerica are synthesized, referring to the strategy that consisted in systematizing the featuresin which the contradictory cultural heterogeneity of Latin Americans manifests, and drawing thelatter’s consequences—but which by the same token constitute the essence of their resistance toall attempts at imposition and cultural subjugation, for Latin American being lies in theability to harmonize the diverse and turn it into a matrix of hope for other peoples. This paper aims at contributing to the debate on socialism from a female perspective. Part I analyzes the situation of women in the best known experiences of so-called XX century “realsocialism.” Part II approaches present feminist thought as the fruit of the crisis of capitalist society and disenchantment with “realsocialism,” while making a brief description of the different trends of thought in its bossom in order to explain the cross debate between patriarcatecapitalism and feminism-socialism in the struggles of left wing women. Finally the ideals of the struggles of Bolivarian women are outlined. This research presents a compilation of notarial documents on the slave trade in the Atlantic through the Canary Islands during the last quarter of the 16th century. The objective of this documentary compendium is to contribute to the approach of the Atlantic mercantile relations, especially during the strengthening of the contacts in the ocean, and to expand the available information on various relative social issues about this treatment, both on slaves and trafckers.\n",
      "2 This paper offers a reading of the Brazilian case Public Prosecutor v. Iara Marques Barcelos under the Logocratic Method. This systematic epistemology-based method was developed by the Harvard Law School Professor Scott Brewer. It guides an analyst to assess the strengths and weaknesses of any type of argument, by helping to determine what degree of warrant the premises of an argument provide for its conclusion. This enterprise involves two main purposes. First, it aims to verify whether Brewer’s method actually may be applicable to the Brazilian legal system and, if the answer is positive, the accommodations it will require. Second, it aims to introduce a work of jurisprudence of logical form in the Brazilian legal scholarship and to draw attention of scholars and professionals about its importance. South American legal theorists have largely prioritized analytical and methodological jurisprudence under the influence of H. L. A. Hart and Ronald Dworkin, and have disregarded the role that tools of logical form play in improving the accuracy of the construction and the evaluation of interpretive and evidentiary arguments.KEYWORDS: logocratic method, jurisprudence of logical form.\n",
      "3 “The past defines the present because mankind has not yet mastered its destiny.”Herbert Marcuse, Eros and Civilization (1955: 58) The aim of the study is to show which areas mainly prefered when the people want to carry out recreational activities in the Kastamonu city center and determine the appropriateness of this area for recreative activity. A questionnaire study was conducted with 100 randomly selected people in order to determine the most frequently used open green area in terms of recreational activity in Kastamonu and the results showed that 89% of the participants prefer the Clock Tower. Thus Clock Tower was determined as a research area in this study. It is revealed the current state of the Clock Tower in scope of the study, plants are used in this area and the purpose of use of these plants is determined and how frequently users use this area and the reasons for not frequent use. In addition, activities that are effected in the area and changes in mood after using the area. The second survey study was conducted on users of the area consisting of 118 people. It is revealed space features existing at Clock Tower and events area identified after that space features that users want to be in this area and events areas. Thus, the aim of the area is to determine the users\\' expectations and the deficiencies and problems in this area. There is no end of the crisis in sight. Even more, the long nightmare of forcing Greece onto its knees during the first half of 2015, using banks instead of tanks, shows the contempt for mankind by established superior powers when it comes to defending their interest in a Hobbesian war, irrespective of subsequent human tragedies. A more detailed and radical analysis is needed, allowing a change of the structures underlying the current situation. One point in question is that the European tragedy was and is part of a global drama. The discussion of main paradigms as growth, nationality, statehood and the like have to be at the heart of any debates, questioning their validity. A radical shift is needed, aiming at a proactive and provocative re-interpretation of the future. This article expounds a new theory of humanity that problematizes the discrete, biomaterialist and materially rational individual of Modernity through sensitivity to the human potential for Conscious Evolution [evolution of the ‘invisible self’, which is to say the cultivation of reason, free will, intuition and the other ‘high epistemological faculties’ that allow humans to actualize the potential for self-mediation of the biological desires and animal (irrational) passions]. After defining Conscious Evolution, comparing it with Mechanical Evolution and providing a brief overview of the epistemological processes involved in Conscious Evolution, we examine the ways in which Modernism axiomatically, logically and practically negates the potential for Conscious Evolution and self-mediation as well as the manifestations of this negation in Modernist epistemology and Modernist social systems like Economic Theology or ‘the police’ that, due to their biomaterialist understanding of humans as discrete, biological, materially rational individuals, aim to mediate biological desires and animal passions through external, forceful, hierarchical domination rather than the cultivation of Conscious Evolution and subsequent actualization of the potential for self-mediation. This critique of epistemological and social systems that seek to create order through external, forceful, hierarchical domination sets the stage for a follow up paper titled “Conscious Evolution, Social Development and Environmental Justice” that critiques contemporary Planning Theory and Practice and calls for planning of social systems from a theoretical perspective where seeking to cultivate Conscious Evolution and the actualization of the social order implicit in the self-mediation made potential by Conscious Evolution is possible (which is to say that (r)evolution of theory must precede (r)evolution of practice). This review aims to show the current state of knowledge in the area of the visual quality of landscapes inurbanized areas and their influence on people’s mental health and well-being. This falls under the passive recreation andpassive exposure to the environmental stimuli present in our cities (such as walking in nature and quiet contemplation) asopposed to active interactions with the landscapes such as horticulture therapy and meditation. Passive exposure to naturalor built environments can shape our mental health patterns throughout the life cycle. Although we know that the quantityof green spaces in the cities can improve the well-being of city inhabitants and contact with natural environments canalleviate various psychological disorders, it is also likely that the quality of green spaces, including seemingly irrelevantlandscape design nuances, can play a more important role for our mental health. At present, one can observe strongdemand from policymakers for generating scientific evidence-based knowledge to provide recommendations for urbandesign and the maintenance of green spaces. The Contemplative Landscape Model is an operationalized construct whichincludes esthetic, environmental, and mental health values of landscapes and could serve as a useful tool to assist in thecurrent need for knowledge. However, more research with an emphasis on causal relationships is needed. The study of farmers\\' values has been the focus of experts, scholars, government officials and the media all the time, which has always been in progress. After Wenchuan earthquake, the values of farmers there have changed a lot. It is an urge problem demanding prompt solution and also a very important part of post-disaster reconstruction. The study and analysis of the core socialist values of the farmers in the earthquake-stricken areas can not only develop the theory further, but also provide reference for the future rural revitalization. This paper analyzes the topic from the following three aspects: the main characteristics, the influencing factors and the guiding strategies of the changes of values. The environmental benefits of sustainability efforts can be rendered less effective due to economic feedback mechanisms. As a remedy against such rebound effects, a reinvestment strategy towards environmental causes has been suggested. Here, a practical implementation of such a reinvestment strategy is presented. It involves a) estimating the financial savings resulting from sustainability efforts, b) informing the participants that the environmental benefit of the efforts is reduced by economic feedback mechanisms and c) asking them to donate a fraction of the expected savings towards environmental causes. An easy-to-use methodology for estimating rebound effects of sustainability efforts is presented in order to quantify the efficacy of this approach. CO2 emission offsets are used as an example of donations towards environmental causes. It is shown, that donating even a small amount (less than 1% of financial savings obtained from conservation or engineering savings) of donated carbon offsets can more than eliminate the estimated rebound effects. This then leads to the restore principle, that states that the environmental benefit of reducing activities with average environmental impact is dramatically improved if a fraction of the resulting financial savings is applied towards environmental causes. This approach is made practical by augmenting the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto with a fourth component: reduce, reuse, recycle and restore. Well-being is a complex combination of physical, psychological, emotional, and social health factors of a person. The feeling of well-being is essential for the overall health of a person and enables them to be successful and achieve what they want in life. There is a paucity of study on the well-being of older adults in Bhutan. This study attempted to assess how older adults in Bhutan perceive their well-being and determine their socio-demographic correlates. The World Health Organization five well-being indexes were applied to measure well-being. Findings indicated above average well-being score with the nature of the relationship with children, education level, and employment status as independent correlates. Efforts to enhance the relationship between family members could be more relevant for the well-being of older adults. Further research on well-being is required to incorporate determinants other than socio-demographic variables. Environment and Social Psychology is launched as a policy, practice and research platform to encourage environmental consciousness that promotes rights of, and justice for, all including environment itself. The challenges ahead are clear. The stated mission and objectives define a paradigmatic sphere where we wish to explore, disseminate, and innovate. Tribes are known for their close proximity with the nature all over the world. They use natural resources as part of their survival while protecting these as part of their duties and obligations. Thus the concept of nature-man–spirit is very ancient as both biological diversity and cultural diversity are directly related to the origin of many tribes in India who personify their origin from some plants and trees protecting them as sacred grooves. The present paper seeks a critical note on the relationship of biodiversity, traditional knowledge and rights of tribes in India. This article discusses Jungian psychology as a debated, and exclusionary field of psychology using Carl Jung’s influential work to provide light on analytical or environmental psychology, and to present the theoretical rapprochement between Jungian and Freudian theories[4]. A succinct look at the realm of analytical psychology is still pertinent looking at the role of environmental psychology considering several demands from the modern world. To position Jung in minority spheres, where most of his critics have seen expressions of discrimination, and anti-Semitism, the key principles of Jungian theories will be highlighted considering various researchers to ascertain whether there is limited knowledge for this mindful inquiry[2]. In terms of environmental psychology, Jung’s relevance is important to assess. The many perspectives espoused by Jungian advocates warrant further analysis and research, but are necessary to reflect on today’s societal needs for positive, environmental, humanistic psychology, and potential creation of the psyche as a social transformational tool in psychoanalysis.\n",
      "4 This article presents an avalanche photodiode with quantum dot layers in its active region which operates at 10µm. Performance of this structure is based on intersubband impact ionization phenomenon in quantum dots. It requires lower energy threshold for the onset of avalanche phenomenon, hence it can work in lower operating voltages than bulks. In this paper, by presenting a theoretical approach for intersubband transition rate and electron-electron interaction the photo-generated current was modeled and consequently the responsivity can be calculated. Results show that peak responsivity at a voltage of 14V is obtained about 1.9 A/W. Also the dark current is modeled and calculated at different temperatures and applied voltages. This article aims to investigate synchronization of UWB signals between transmitter and receiver in communication networks. In Ultra wideband technology, synchronization consists of two sections. In the former section coarse synchronization has been accomplished which leads to fine one at the end. In first section of coarse synchronization, maximum detection was utilized. In order to improve the performance of the synchronization algorithm and decreasing the complexity of calculation, in second section of coarse synchronization search back algorithm was presented. Synchronizations were performed in MATLAB and the results were the indication of a decrease in calculation and improvement in synchronization performance. To evaluate the performance of synchronization algorithms MAE, RMSE were utilized as two criteria and the results obtained explains the fact that RMSE criterion in search back algorithm has better performance for lower SNR. Fiber Ring Lasers employed for generation of the multi-wavelength laser with so narrow bandwidth. In this research, the setup of multi-wavelength fiber ring laser source is demonstrated as well as eight figure cavity that by using a piece of Polarization Maintaining Fiber (PMF) in Sagnac filter achieved four stable and constant amplitude wavelengths with same spacing at room temperature. Also, we observed more than 250 narrow line width modes by using the 23 km length of Single Mode Fiber (SMF-28) at C and L communication windows which the stability of modes because of increasing the length was more less in compare to PMF Sagnac. During mission all of the telecommunication and electronic components in satellites expose to ionizing radiation. This factor can cause damage to the structure and function of the satellite. This paper examines the different structures that make radiation shielding satellites in GEO orbit. In this work, the amount of ionizing radiation is calculated using the MCNPX code. The simulation results indicate the importance of each factor in designing shielding. The design of MMICs is essentially the same as that for most microwave components: one or more signals must be coupled onto the chip efficiently, then functions are performed on the signals, after which they are then coupled out of the chip and back into the system. the efficient coupling of signal power requires that the impedance of the signal source match that of the chip. In fact, to pass the signal efficiently through the whole chip, the impedances of the transmission lines, the active devices, and the system it sits in must all be matched. MMIC design is founded on impedance matching and control across the frequency range of interest. Gain and Noise Figure of a typical transistor is decreased and increased in terms of frequency increase, respectively. Abstract— An ultra-low-voltage ultra-low-power operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) is presented in this paper. The proposed topology based on a bulk driven input differential pair. Two separate capacitors have been used for compensation of the opamp where one of them is used in a signal path and another one in a non-signal path. The circuit is designed in the 0.18µm CMOS technology. The simulation results show that the amplifier has a 84.1dB open-loop DC gain and a unity gain-bandwidth of 81 KHz while operating at 0.5V supply voltage. The total power consumption is as low as 900nW which makes it suitable for low-power bio-medical applications. This paper presents a 6 to 64 GHz passive distributed drain mixer implemented by using a standard 0.13 um CMOS process. To improve the bandwidth, low conversion loss and low noise figure, filtering structures is utilized for wideband matching. Both Chebyshev and Butterworth filters are used instead of the classical constant-k sections of the conventional DA in order to form respectively the gate and drain transmission lines. This mixer consumes zero dc power and exhibits a conversion loss of 4.9-7.9 dB and noise figure (DSB) of 6.8-8.1 dB from 6 to 64 GHz. Abstract— In this paper, a new ultra-low-voltage ultra-low-power operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) using feed-forward technique is proposed. The proposed topology is based on a bulk driven input differential pair employs a gain-stage in the Miller capacitor feedback path to improve the pole-splitting effect. In addition, through a coupling capacitance, input signal is simultaneously coupled to gate of idle transistors resulted dramatic enhancement in gain and unity gain-bandwidth (UGB) of the OTA. The circuit is designed in the 0.18µm CMOS technology. The simulation results show that the amplifier has a 90dB open-loop DC gain and a unity gain-bandwidth of 270 kHz while operating at 0.5V supply voltage. This technique show remarkable enhancement in unity gain-bandwidth and also in DC gain compared to the bulk driven input differential pair technique. The total power consumption is as low as 900nW which makes it suitable for low-power bio-medical applications. This article introduces the reader to the performance limitations of micro electro mechanical gap-tuning capacitors fabricated in the commercially PolyMUMPs (Polysilicon Multi-user MEMS Process) foundry. And the advantages of the CMOS technology to fabrication of MEMS tunable capacitors are discussed. Also to increase the both of tuning range and quality factor, a three-plate MEMS tunable capacitor with two movable plates is designed and simulated. The simulation of the capacitor was done using the EM3DS software which is demonstrated wide tuning range (300 percent), that is 6 times higher than tuning range of the conventional parallel plate capacitor. The proposed capacitor are designed by using the ALCU metal layers of TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS technology that have caused decreasing the series resistance and increasing the quality factor to 300 in 1 GHZ. In this paper, formulation of the problem of plane wave diffraction by a wedge with anisotropic impedances is given for the case of almost grazing incidence. All steps of problem are given in detailed. Wedge is a canonic structure and diffraction from wedge may be used in modelling scattering from a variety of complex structures. In this study, by using the Maxwell’s equations the field components can be expressed in terms of z-components. By applying appropriate boundary conditions, a coupled system of equations is obtained in terms of field component and derivatives of field components with respect to and r. By using similarity transform to the coupled system of equations, the coupling is reduced to the simplest form in which Malyuzhinets theorem can be applied. The solution of field components is sought in the form of Sommerfeld integrals. The Malyuzhinets theorem is applied to the Sommerfeld integrals. By using Sommerfeld integrals the problem is reduced to a system of coupled functional equations. Solution of homogeneous functional equations is given in terms of χф functions. For a small parameter of the problem (sinθ0&lt;&lt;1 where θ0 is the angle between z-axis and incident wave) the perturbation procedure is used to reduce the coupled functional equations to a system of linear equations with this small parameter being at the integral terms of equations. As a result the closed form solution is given for functional equations. The obtained analytic expression for the spectral functions is substituted to the Sommerfeld integrals, which are evaluated by means of steepest descent technique.Then, the analytical expressions for the diffraction coefficient for both magnetic and electric field components are derived. Considering these different geometries and small skewness angle, it is concluded that this approach enlarge the class of solvable diffraction problem in a small range. Additionally, the results are valuable for the comparison purposes for the other approximate methods. Over the years, the discussion about achieving knowledge and discovering unknowns have attracted a lot of people and occasionally a news or text or short understanding of a new science absorbs scholars and people motivated to learn .looking in to the modern technology, we see new inventions and innovations which are unique .as an example, over the past years ,new technology has been created in computer networks of which metro Ethernet has had a Noticeable advance in urban communication. therefore the aim of this article is to provide and compile information regarding metro Ethernet technology. utilizing Ethernet in urban networks need the developing potential and strength that only exist in MPLS and IP levels. layer two and three joint networks are solutions that join simplicity and economy of Ethernet at IP/MPLS scale. Different transfer technologies have been used in metro so metro services should be given on a mixture of optic and data switches, MPLS have been developed for this work and using generalized-MPLScontrol surface that support both data and optic switches performs it .In the beginning theories about using metro technology to produce urban networks are explained. then a simulating called eNSP which is a suitable alternative for simulating metro Ethernet technology and at the end the result of the simulation will be presented.\n",
      "5 Stratification and social class are two different things but are very often used interchangeably. Class has a narrower meaning than social stratification. if class is more specific then stratification has a broader meaning because it refers more to the division of a group of people or society at their respective levels. And this belongs to the layers that exist in society. Something similar like this of course also happened to the people of the Sultanate of Palembang Darusslam. Moreover, Palembang has a strategic location which makes its port so that it can be said to be in the international arena which makes traders from outside also come. So it does not rule out if the European nation is interested in both agricultural products and areas from Palembang. This research tries to be able to better explain the social conditions that existed in society during the Palembang Darussalam sultanate during the transition period to be precise. So the researchers hope that this can be a way of knowing more about the history of the Palembang Darussalam sultanate in transition and also being one of the categories of preservation of Palembang history This paper discusses the role of Ki.Kms.H.M. Zen Mukti in politics and religion in Palembang. Ki.Kms.H.M. Zen Mukti is a former Masjumi member, his contribution to politics and da\\'wah in Palembang is quite capable. The accusation of Masyumi\\'s involvement in the PRRI (Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia) provides a dark note for former Masjumi members during the New Order era. In this study tries to reveal the other side of the former Masjumi party members and analyze why the former Masjumi members transitioned to cultural Islam during the New Order era. This study uses three data collection techniques such as literature study, interviews and documentation. The type of research used is qualitative by referring to historical research procedures, the sociology approach is used as an auxiliary science in research by focusing on social stratification theory and role theory to analyze the position and status of Ki.Kms.H.M. Zen Mukti. This research describes the progress of Ki.Kms.H.M. Zen Mukti in political and religious activities in Palembang. This research also reveals that in the New Order era, the role of bureaucratic clerics became suspended in political matters. The triumph of the Masjumi party members during the Old Order became dim in the hands of the New Order regime. The New Order regime\\'s intervention against political clerics also influenced their role in the life of the state. The purpose of this study was to determine the life background and role of Ki.Kms.H.M. Zen Mukti as a bureaucratic scholar who contributes to politics and religion in Palembang. This research discusses the Khairuddin Barabrossa movement in the ocean wich has attracted sympathy from several circles, with the result that giving rise to different views on his movement. His revenge action at sea created a negative stigma and was claimed as a pirate. Khairuddin Barbarossa alliance with the Ottoman goverment is a form of contradiction that will answer the Western stigma. The result of this study reveral that the Khairuddin Barbarossa movement originated from the motive of revenge, so tha the Western view claim that this his movement is an act of pirates who are separated from the official authority of the government or kingdom.&nbsp; In contrast to the Islamic viewpoint, the Khairuddin Barbarossa movement is called material nautical jihad, that means a series of attacks carried out by Muslim againts oppression an looting by Spanish Christians. Islamic views are based on what Khairuddin Barbarossa did with the Ottoman Turks during the reign of Sultan&nbsp; Salim I, with the result that movement at sea officially has the authority. Al-Muwahiddun Dynasty is an Islamic Dynasty in North Africa which was founded in 515 H/1121 AD, the founder of this dynasty was Muhammad bin Tumart through religious and political movements. This research tries to reveal the religious and political movements undertaken by Muhammad bin Tumart to rule North Africa. Data collection techniques from this study are in the form of book sources related to Muhammad bin Tumart and the Al-Muwahiddun Dynasty. This research uses qualitative data types with a historical approach and the theory uses role theory. This research reveals the religious and political movements undertaken by Muhammad bin Tumart to launch his ambition to overthrow the Al-Muwahiddun Dynasty and establish a new dynasty. To fulfil this ambition, he committed various religious deviations in order to attract sympathy for the tribes in North Africa to rebel from the rulers (Al-Murabithun Dynasty) and establish a new dynasty (Al-Muwahiddun Dynasty). The existence of a dukun using Malinowski\\'s functional theory. Historically, dukuns had an important role in pre-postpartum care, but now the existence of dukuns is starting to be abandoned. However, there are several community groups that still maintain the existence of a dukun, one of which is the people of Muara Intan Village. This study is focused on answering problems, including: (1) The general condition of the community in Muara Intan Village; (2) The role of the dukun in Muara Intan Village; and (3) The position of the dukun in Muara Intan Village. The method used is ethnography using participant observation techniques, interviews, documentation, and collecting audio-visual material in the form of pictures, photos, or recordings. Data analysis will take place simultaneously with other parts of the development of this research, namely data collection and writing of findings. The focus of this research is the dukun and the community who use the dukun services. The results of this study indicate that the existence of a dukun is still maintained because the biological needs of the community have not been fulfilled only with the help of medical personnel. Especially in meeting reproductive needs, namely during pregnancy, childbirth, after childbirth, breastfeeding, and baby care. Maintaining the culture is not the main reason, but it is because the dukun is still there that makes it a tradition in society. In this regard, it is necessary to regenerate the dukun, so that the dukun\\'s presence is maintained in the community. The problem in this study is divided into 2 (two), namely: first, how is the history of the establishment of Nurul Iman Islamic boarding school. Second, what is the contribution of Nurul Iman Islamic boarding school to the community of Ujung Tanjung Pangkalan Village, Balai Banyuasin III. The purpose of this study was to find out how the history of the Nurul Iman Islamic Boarding School was founded and to find out what the contribution of Nurul Iman Islamic Boarding School to the Village Community of Ujung Tanjung Pangkalan Balai Banyuasin III. This research uses history and sociology. The use of a historical approach so that researchers try to reconstruct the past systematically and objectively, by collecting, evaluating, verifying, and synthesizing evidence to uphold facts and obtain strong conclusions. There are two sources of data used by the authors, namely primary data and secondary data. The results of research that have been carried out are the development of the Nurul Iman Islamic boarding school in Ujung Tanjung Village, which in its early days was still in a traditional form, then developed into an Islamic educational institution (Pesantren), this was marked by the establishment of the Nurul Iman Islamic Boarding School in 1960 AD. The contribution made by the Nurul Iman Islamic boarding school is divided into 3, namely: first, the economic sector: the Islamic boarding school cooperative, which also involves the community in Ujung Tanjung Village; second, the education sector: consisting of formal education and non-formal education; and third: the socio-religious field: majelis taklim and the art of reading Al-Qur\\'an. This paper is entitled about H. Asnawi Mangku Alam\\'s Thought and Devotion in South Sumatra in 1921-2001. In this paper, he explains the biography of social life, environment and education, as well as the thoughts and dedication of the figure H. Asnawi Mangku Alam. This writing uses the historical method, with heuristic stages, source criticism, interpretation, and historiography. The theory used is the social exchange theory put forward by George Casper Homans and the habitus theory put forward by Pierre Bourdieu. H. Asnawi Mangku Alam is a local figure from South Sumatra who made a big contribution to independence. After studying, he devoted himself to being actively involved in the military field and playing a role in the struggle to defend Indonesia\\'s independence in the Palembang and Komering regions in 1947. As well as being a governor, Asnawi Mangku Alam was also the Ambassador for Burma and Nepal. The author describes three areas of contribution from the thought of H. Asnawi Mangku Alam when he was appointed governor of South Sumatra in 1968-1978, namely the fields of religion, economy and politics. As for some of the writings of H. Asnawi Mangku Alam and then the writer made the source in writing. Among them are a collection of Da\\'wah, a collection of sermons, a farmer\\'s son to become a governor, a 120 hour city war in Palembang, Padamu Lies Laitaul Qadar, Cita and Karya, as well as messages and impressions. This article intends to provide an overview of the causes of the shift, as well as the impact caused by changing traditions in a community in 30 Ilir Palembang Village. The purpose of this study is to describe the causes of the shift in the Ngidang Tradition in 30 Ilir Palembang Village. This type of research is qualitative descriptive with primary data sources consisting of: field executors, 30 Ilir communities, traditional heads, religious leaders. and secondary sources consisting of literature studies, documentation, and journals. The data collection technique uses the interview, observation, and documentation methods.The results of this study are changes and shifts in the Ngidang tradition caused by several factors, economic factors, times of development, lineage, and modernization. The impact caused by the shift in the Ngidang tradition is divided into 2, namely Negative Damapak: the weak intensity of community interaction, the relationship between communities is not strong, making the loss of local culture or traditions owned by the community as a characteristic of society. The positive impact is the development of the human mindset that produces the latest innovations that result in an increase in the life sector. This research is entitled The Tradition of Monitoring Bunting in the Sukarami Village Community of Pagaralam, from the main point of this research: 1.How is the procession of the implementation of the Pantauan Bunting tradition in the marriage of the Sukarami village community. The purpose of this study was to find out the procession of the implementation of the pregnant monitoring tradition in marriage in the Sukarami village community. To find out the changes and developments in the marriage monitoring tradition of the Sukarami village community. From the results of the research carried out, the researchers found several new things that the Bunting Monitoring Tradition is a tradition that is still carried out by the Pasemah community, especially the Sukarami village community in a series of wedding ceremony activities in the form of invitations or invitations to eat from the local community for newly married couples. . This Bunting Monitoring tradition is carried out with the aim of profiting Muji Jurai or respecting descendants, as gratitude and respect for their descendants because someone is already married, or it can also be said as a gift from the community to the bride. The topic of this research needs to be investigated because at that time there were many events related to the description of the struggle of many Islamic figures in advancing Islam, especially Mahmud Ghazni. During the reign of Mahmud Ghazni Islamic civilization experienced rapid progress and during the reign of Mahmud Ghazni much progress in the fields of education and the economy. Mahmud Ghazni was a man who controlled Islam and had a lot of influence and power during wars and often won over his enemies until the caliph Al-Qadir Billah gave him the title Yamin addaulah which means people who are trusted by the government and Amin Addaulah which means trusted by\n",
      "6 This report seeks to expose the general rules governing the issuance of bonds in Chile, also presenting briefly some similarities and differences with certain aspects of comparative law.The second part of this study will focus on the particular defense mechanisms of bondholders, over other investors, positioning them as privileged subjects within the national legal system, given the importance that the proper functioning of the capital market in the country has, in consideration to the adoption of a system of social security contributions based on individual capitalization for more than thirty years. The producer liability for the guarantee of quality and suitability of products is ruled today as a subspecies of responsibility in regards to consumer protection that has special nuances.This article aims to address theoretically the producer liability for guarantees of goods and services in order to define its characteristics and scope and to differentiate it from traditional private law figures, such as the obligation to repair concealed imperfections and the proper functioning guarantee of the Colombian Commercial Code. Part of the different hypotheses that support the developments of law sociology in Colombia revolve around measuring the distance between law and society and understanding the influence of law on social reality, becoming the study object par excellence. In order to establish said relation, the article sought to rebuild the social imaginary regarding the ideas and thoughts of a particular region and time by collecting news sources between the years 1969 - 1970, about the personality attribute of the Colombian natives. To do this, the article rebuilds a particular event brought up to local criminal justice, “La Rubiera” massacre, to observe that fateful perception about the personality of the indigenous people. As a reflection phenomenon produced by a mirror, this metaphorical tool of social sciences allows to study, through this historic event, the responsible institution for sustaining social control: Law. Institution that, socially speaking, is responsible for attributing and describing personality, as a legal category, to the citizens. Currently considered the crimes against humanity, among others, applying the principle of criminal justice jurisdiction or universal, thereby eventually this kind of crime can be investigated and tried under the Statute of the International Criminal Court or in the exercise of that same principle exercised by any country. Countries like Spain, UK, Belgium, etc.., have applied universal jurisdiction in media cases of former Argentine military or the famous case of Augusto Pinochet. This paper makes a brief analysis of the offenses that achieve standards that are protective of transgressing universal legal goods. Our primary goal is to explain this principle in order to avoid impunity in crimes of international nature. For this reason it is clarified in the Principle of Universal Jurisdiction applied in Spain, in that perspective we analyze recent crimes against humanity that occurred in Colombia that are subsumed under the category of crimes that could be brought to universal jurisdiction in that sense are studied the characteristics of the extraterritoriality of Colombian criminal law at the international level. This article analyzes the philosophical foundations of human rights doctrine from the perspective of the Critical Theory of Recognition. Initially, the article revisit the origins of the concepts of human person and human dignity according to the contributions from the Jewish-Christian tradition, aiming to show the bonds between the conception of human rights and a specific cultural tradition. Afterwards, the article introduces the theoretical proposal of reinterpretation of human rights based on discursive postulates, before normative postulates, with the purpose to bring closer the parties involved in the debate according to the cultural traditions and other bonds capable to produce relations of recognition. Finally, the article analyzes how the Theory of Recognition could collaborate with an epistemological redefinition of the category of human rights. Procedures of prosthetic breast implants, either as cosmetic plastic surgery or for reconstructive purposes, can cause damage to patients; because of defective prosthetic implants, damages that generate harm may arise to users of health services, which must be compensated by the providers of these services or the state agency responsible for inspecting, monitoring and controlling. To protect their assets, the perpetrators legitimized by passive and potential damage generators can transfer the inherent risks of their activities to an insurance company. The following study is part of the research project The Madrid Protocol as a stimulating element for franchises in Colombia; a preliminary document that aims to elucidate the main theoretical aspects of the Madrid Protocol, and its applications regarding trademarks, trademark law, trademark registration and franchises. This article analyzes the elements that make possible the legal significance of the Madrid Protocol. In trademarks, it highlights its constitutive elements and their historic development. Finally, it analyzes the role of the franchise as a driving force for trade relations under the current conditions created by technological development. The Cartagena Agreement has been regarded as the foundation of the “integrationist construction” of the Andean countries, which can go further if it adopts an integrated approach. Through this article, the Andean integration process is analyzed from the political and legal aspects, considering that the academic production of the Andean Community is mostly limited to the economic perspective. The research progresses in these facets are based mainly on the analysis of the legitimacy of the CAN and the need to contextualize the Andean states regarding the new global reality in ways that go beyond the economic sphere. The market demands a more efficient performance from legal entities. Outsourcing or tertiarization has become an important tool for companies that adjust themselves to the requirements that the market imposes, it also grants a better organization of activities and achieves the highest performance in the competition process. This study analyzed the subcontracting process amidst the transformations that Brazilian society has experienced, regarding the relaxation of labor laws. This study analyzes the relation between the expenses on the justice sector and criminality during the twentieth century in Colombia. For this purpose, the municipal expenditure budgets intended for justice departments, the number of crimes compiled annually by the Statistical Yearbooks of Colombia and the National Census of 1918, 1938 and 1948 were revised. Among other findings, it was established that the decisions of municipal councils regarding expenses on justice affected the performance and efficiency of judicial institutions and the level of crime. This article aims to account the mutations which private international law has gone through because of globalization processes that took place at the beginning of the decade of the ‘90s. The emergence of new patterns of interaction among nations, such as regionality, supranationality, transnationality, etc.., have redefined, based on these associative instances, traditional relations between states, generating new legal and political interaction processes between them. This article, emerged as a contemporary reflection of wider research undertaken on the topic addressed during the years 2010-2011, examines the continuities, ruptures and tensions that exist between private international law and state-based law.Additionally, the crisis of national sovereignty structured around a territorialist conception of jurisdiction, among others, has played down the role of the State as the “only subject” of international relations. Indeed, the emergence of new actors, new practices, new discourses, etc..., has reshaped the balance of power and interests that structure it. The redefinition of the “national sovereignty / international jurisdiction” pairing in the light of globalization processes and emerging regionalism, has created a new space for interaction that needs to be formalized and made visible. To this end, this paper proposes, first, to define the position and legal nature of private international law in the context of a diversified global law and in the light of new and emerging legal practices with their respective legal frames and second, to identify some of the problems that arise in this area of law, regarding Integration Law, regionality, and supranationality under which bilateral relations between nations and between them and the private sector enroll.\n",
      "7 Based on the agricultural production, Indonesia has very high potential to increase mulberry production through the implementation of adapted and liable technology. The research was conducted to study the ability of mulberry leave meal addition concentrates on the performance of Ongole Grade. This experiment used a randomized block design, with 4 treatments and 4 blocks. Treatments consisted of P1 (native grass and concentrate feed in the form of mulberry leaves meal and concentrate complete), P2 (native grass and concentrate feed in the form of mulberry leaves meal and corn concentrate), P3 (native grass and concentrate feed in the form of mulberry leaves meal and rice bran concentrate), P4 (native grass and concentrate feed in the form of mulberry leaves meal and concentrate tapioca waste). The experiment was conducted for 4 months with the adaptation periods for 2 weeks. Parameters measured were feed consumption, daily body weight gain, feed efficiency, Income Over Feed Cost (IOFC), revenue cost ratio. The results showed that the mulberry leave meal addition on different concentrate did not significantly (P>0,05) affect daily body weight gain, feed consumption, feed efficiency and Income Over Feed Cost (IOFC), and revenue cost Ratio. It is concluded that based on the nutrient digestibility, mulberry leave meal concentrate can be combined with a single concentrate such as corn, cassava waste meal or complete concentrate. Kata kunci: Pakan murbei, sapi PO, Income Over Feed Cost (IOFC) This study was conducted to ascertain the effect of adding probiotic into feed on the quality of quail’s eggs. Lactobacillus salivarius encapsulation (Ls encaps) was used as probiotic. A randomized block design was used to assign four levels of Ls encaps administration, that is P0 = Standard feed without Ls encaps, P1 = P0 + 107 cells/g Ls encaps, P2 = P0 + 108 cells/g Ls encaps and P3 = P0 + 109 cells/g Ls encaps. The results showed that adding Ls encaps did not alter significant egg quality (egg weight, the level protein of egg, and egg shell) but it significantly lowered cholesterol content in egg. In conclusion, L. Salivarius encaps may be used as a feed additive in quail diets to reduce egg cholesterol content.43.85 %, respectively. In conclusion, Ls encaps may be used as a feed additive for quail to enhance egg quality leading to improve our health. Keywords: probiotic, egg quality, cholesterol and quail. Abstrak This research aimed to investigate the effect of whole hatchery waste meal (WHWM) or shelless hatchery waste meal (SHWM) in the ration on digestible nutrient and apparent metabolizable energy (AME).A total of 500 quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) 30 days with average initial body weight 94,7 ± 4,2 g were used. The research wasdesigned to completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 5 replicate with 20 quails per replicate. The dietary treatments were: P0 = basal ration, P1 = 96% basal ration + 4% WHWM, P2 = 92% basal ration + 8% WHWM, P3 = 96% basal ration+ 4% SHWM and P4 = 92% basal ration + 8% SHWM. Commercial ration was fed to quails aged 30–39days.At the age of 40–42 days quails were adapted to basal ration. The nutrient digestibility was measured using total collection method after 2 × 28days of treatment. The data were analyzed using variance analysis and if there was a treatment effect, continued by orthogonal contrast test.The results showed that feeding WHWM or SHWM up to 8% increasedthe digestible crude fat and AME but did not increase digestible crude protein and dry matter. The digestible crude fat and AME of quails fed SHWM was higher than that of quails fed WHWM. Furthermore, the digestible crude fat of quails fed 8% WHWM was higher than that of quails 4%, but the opposite result was obtainedforAME. Feeding 8% SHWM generated in a higher digestible crude fat than 4% SHWM.

Forage is a ruminant animal basal feed, where sufficient and continuous availability and good quality must be a priority. Place to growth or location, also determine the existence and production of forage including grass species in this study. This study aims to determine how much the production of elephant grass, panicum and cetaria on salinity differences. The study was conducted for 4 months, in Kompleks Perumahan dosen UNIPA Amban in Manokwari West Papua. The study was designed with a split plot design in to Completely Randomize design (CRD) 4x3 with 4 replications. As the main plot is grass species and the subplot is salinity based on growing media. Factor I is grass species (Sp) consisting of: Pennisetum purpureum (Sp1), Panicum maximum (Sp2) and Setaria spacelata (Sp3) and then Factor II is growing media (M) consisting of: soil 100% (M0), soil 70% + 30% of sand (M1), soil 50% + 50% of sand (M2) and soil 30% + 70% of sand (M3). Statistical analysis shows that the effect of salinity is significant (P&lt;0.05) on plant growth variable, namely fresh matter production, dry matter production and stem leaf ratio. Planting media M1 (soil 70% + sand 30%) perform the best result, and species that is responsive to salinity is Panicum maximum (Sp2). Sidrap as a rice granary center in South Sulawesi, plays an active role in efforts to self-sufficiency in eastern Indonesian food in particular and NKRI in general. The efforts of integrated rice cultivation have been carried out as an effort to achieve national food independence. This paper discusses the population density of green leafhoppers, predatory insects, and other pests in the Inpari 36 rice crop as tungro (new released) varieties in endangered areas, the study was carried out in the experimental garden area of Tungro Disease Research, using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) 2 plot plots of plant varieties of 10 x 10 m2 with 4 replications. The most common adult green leafhopper (Nephotetic verescens) results in Inpari 36 varieties without bioprotector treatment. Natural predators that were fluctuated every week were dominant observations, namely: Agriocnemis spp, Micraspis sp, Conocephalus longipennis, Araenus inustus, Lycosa pseudoannulata, Oxyopes javanacus, and Tetraghenata maxilosa. While at 6-7 MST (weeks after planting) Ophionea nigrofasciata species appeared and in 7MST there were species of Anaxipa longipennis. Tamarillo has soft characteristics and contains a lot of water so they are easily damaged if stored in fresh form, therefore it is necessary to have post-harvest handling in the form of processing in order to extend the shelf life. The study aims to analyze the costs, income, and profits, as well as the feasibility seen from the R / C, break event point (BEP), and the added value of various tamarillo processed products. The study was conducted in a survey of all tamarillo processed agroindustry in Wonosobo Regency, which amounted to 6 agroindustries. The research method used is descriptive quantitative analysis. The study uses primary data obtained through interviews and secondary data by means of documentation. Tamarillo processed products consist of candied, fruit juice, dodol, wajik, and candied pumpkin. The results showed that the production of candied tamarillo is the most compared to other processed products and can generate the greatest income and profits. All tamarillo processed products are feasible based on R/C, BEP, and value-added criteria. The development of tamarillo agro-industry needs the support of the government and related parties to provide education to consumers about the benefits of tamarillo.

      "8 Abstract. A new subspecies of the genus Sphingnotus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). According to the species keys of this genus, Sphingnotus mirabilis Boisduval should be assigned a new subspecies, 1835. The new subspecies is more similar to S. m. mirabilis Boisduval, which has different variations from blue-green to purple-black and coppery color, while this new subspecies has different characteristics described below. This is an open letter to researchers in specimen-based taxonomic herpetology, to bring to your attention a new open-access peer-reviewed journal which emphasizes the importance of type material and voucher specimens in taxonomy and systematics. Apostolepis is a speciose Neotropical snake genus, encompassing approximately 40 species, widely distributed at South America. Most species of the genus are known based on small series, which has contributed to a convoluted taxonomic history. In this study, we report the rediscovery of Apostolepis niceforoi, a taxon that remained known from a single specimen since 1935, providing a detailed redescription, with comments on its close congeners, as well as taxonomic misidentifications related to this species. Despite being well-described, Azara\\'s No. 193 Suiriri pardo amarillo menor has never been conclusively identified. Indeed, during the 19th Century it was usually associated with species in the genus Myiarchus, despite the cup nest description provided being incompatible with that genus. In the early 20th Century it became associated with Elaenia obscura, and that has not been seriously questioned since. However, Paraguayan populations formerly attributed to E. obscura are now known as E. sordida, a species that is rare in Paraguay and incompatible with the original description. In this paper I argue that the true identity of No. 193 is Large Elaenia E. spectabilis (Pelzeln, 1868), a common species in Paraguay, and this error of understanding is responsible for many early 20th Century Paraguayan reports of E. obscura. Azara\\'s description predates the type description of E. spectabilis by 63 years. Abstract.The R. dianneae species group of the genus Rosenbergia is described and enlarged with the additional descriptions of R. cheesmanae sp. nov. and R. valentinae eki ssp. nov. Adult genitalia are depicted. The R. weiskei species group is analysed and Rosenbergia valentinae Rigout, 2004 stat. nov. is raised to species level and no longer considered a subspecies of R. dianneae Allard, 1990. The rediscovery of the holotype of Rosenbergia humeralis Gilmour, 1966 allows for the description of the male of this species. After extensive research, the holotype of R. dianneae is considered lost and a neotype has been designated. Â Augochloropsis, with 150 species, is the most speciose Augochlorini genus. These tÃ¡xon occupy a wide spectrum of social behavior ranging from the solitary to primitively eusocial. In the present study, I provide a description of a new species Augochloropsis beatrice from Bahia, Northeast Brazil, and a key to Bahia occurring species and their distribution. introductionBioArt is a broad term used to introduce manyartworks. In order to simplify, two main points offocus could be examined: one is devoted to increasingand ordering our knowledge about life, whilst thesecond one involves the ethical implications derivedfrom the â€œlivingâ€ tissue on which BioArtists work. The oceans are a vast yet fragile environment, and one of the biggest issues scientists have to tackle today is the conservation of marine biodiversity. In 1975, to try to address the physical, chemical and biological alteration of these delicate ecosystems, 16 Mediterranean States together with the European Union, implemented the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP). The aim was to safeguard the marine environment and promote its development in the Mediterranean basin. Julijonas Urbonas presents his project Planet of people, brought by the Lithuanian Space Agency in the Lithuanian Pavilion, and is curated by Jan Boelen. Two new distribution records for Western New Guinea for Metaxymorpha Parry, 1848 and one for Calodema Gory &amp; Laporte, 1838, previously known only from Papua New Guinea, are reported. In addition, Calodema wallacei meeki ssp. nov. is described based on an old specimen in the collection of Neervoort van de Poll. New corrigenda to previous published records are also reported.\n",
      "9 Homework had become a tradition in teaching and learning mathematics in school. Even so, in Indonesia, there is not enough research on homework. Our research is conducted to investigate high school students’ views on homework and to provide the basis for further research on homework in Indonesia. In this research, we use exploratory-descriptive qualitative to explore and describe the students’ view of homework. We collected the data from 124 high school students by using the structured interview conducted via online form. The data were analyzed by using the thematic analysis. Based on our results, we found that (1) students know that mathematics homework can help them with their academic achievement and their attitudes toward their studies, (2) mathematics homework is not high on their priority, (3) it makes them tired physically and mentally, and (4) students argue that mathematics problems are better to be solved in the class where they can ask the teacher. We also found their difficulties in doing their homework, such as (1) lack of knowledge (2) their teachers do not give them the necessary ‘tools’ to solve the problems, (3) they can’t ask for helping hands if they can’t solve the problems (4) some emotional problems such as motivation, and (5) other priorities are higher on their list. This current study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the guided discovery model in increasing students\\' critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions. Each experiment and control group consisted of 34 students of grade X of one high school class in Bandar Lampung city. The data were obtained through mathematical critical thinking skills test and critical thinking dispositions scale. The data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to obtain a comprehensive description of the impact of learning on the increase in both skills. The results showed that the increase of students’ critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions after learning was in the effective category. Other finding showed that the use of a contextual problem in the beginning of learning could trigger students to activate their prior knowledge. In this way, students used some strategies and made an appropriate conclusion confidently. This study suggested that the guided discovery model can be an alternative to improve students\\' critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions. Remote learning that must be carried out by schools in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic was a challenge for most teachers. This study aimed to investigate mathematical conversations maintained by the teachers in remote learning of mathematics during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a descriptive qualitative study that was analyzed based on school time during the pandemic, online teaching platforms used, the way the teachers carry out remote learning of mathematics, and how the teachers and the students interact. The data were collected from three mathematics teachers and eight students in a public senior high school in Bekasi District, Indonesia. They were interviewed by phone, and then the results of the interview were complemented by several captures of the students\\' conversations when learning mathematics via WhatsApp. This study revealed that remote learning of mathematics was still dominated by a rigid or less interactive learning environment, which could be seen from how the teachers gave mathematics problems, questions, and instructions, as well as how they responded to student questioning. Textbooks play a key role in teaching mathematics in many Indonesian classrooms. Therefore, the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture provides textbooks for use in schools to support the teaching and learning process in the classroom. In implementing the Curriculum 2013 (Kurikulum 2013) in elementary schools, the textbooks were designed and developed by integrating various competencies and subjects, including mathematics, into several themes. This study aimed to describe the place value content in students’ thematic textbooks for elementary school students in grades 1 and 2. A descriptive qualitative method in the content analysis was conducted by focusing on three areas of analysis: six critical skills of learning place value, stages development, and strategies in teaching place value. Some findings showed that the thematic textbooks for grades 1 and 2 covered almost all skills except mentioning numbers in other forms (rename), the material presented has developed according to students’ learning development, and has implemented all strategies in teaching place values. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of CBT and PBT national examination in terms of students’ cognitive readiness and anxiety facing mathematics national examination in DIY province, the influence of major in terms of students’ cognitive readiness and anxiety facing mathematics national examination in DIY Province, and the interaction between national examination and major. This research was descriptive explorative and the method was ex-post facto. The population was all of natural and social science high school students in grade XII in DIY province. The number of sample used was 654 students The results showed that there was influence of national examination in terms of students’ cognitive readiness and anxiety facing national examination. CBT and PBT national examination did not influence the cognitive readiness facing national examination, CBT and PBT national examination influence in national examinations in terms of students’ anxiety facing national examination. The average score of the students’ anxiety facing CBT national exam was greater than that of the students’ anxiety facing PBT national examination. There was no effect caused by differences in majoring in terms of cognitive readiness and national examination math anxiety; and there was no interaction between the different types of national examinations and majors. The skills of reading, interpreting and constructing graphs are important for students. These skills are related to mathematical representation. The purpose of this study is to analyze Grade 8 students’ representation errors in solving word problems related to graphs in one of junior high schools in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. The data were obtained based on a mathematics test administered to 36 students and a short interview conducted for five selected students. The test consisted of eight problems adapted from four contexts of PISA problems related to graph. Students’ representation errors were classified based on the errors of changing one representation to another representation, such as visual to verbal, visual to symbolic, visual to visual and verbal to visual. The results reveal that representation errors are not solely influenced by the types of representation. It is indicated by the questions with similar representation resulted in a different percentage of students committing representation errors. In general, the students’ representation errors are due to the fact that students not being familiar with the problems requiring representation; students not being used to solve PISA context problems and word problems; as well as the teachers’ time constraint in teaching non-routine problems. The rapid development of technology offers many advantages to the proses of learning in the classroom. This experimental research aimed to investigates the effectiveness of learning mathematics delivered through blended learning. In particular, this study compared the effectiveness of blended learning using Moodle and traditional one in relation to students’ conceptual understanding. The data was gathered through written test and interview. This study involved 127 students of grade eight secondary school. The data shows that students who learn in blended learning approach have better conceptual understanding rather than their counterparts. The students claim that they can access learning material and revisit some difficult material in their convenience time. Nevertheless, there are some obstacles faced by students related to maintaining their motivation to learn independently and keeping distraction off to access other website when they learn online.Key words: blended learning, conceptual understanding This research aims to produce mathematics textbook for grade VII junior high school students based on realistic mathematics and oriented to the mathematical reasoning and mathematical communication. The quality is determined based on Nieveen criteria, including validity, practicality, and effectiveness.This study was a research and development and used Borg & Gall model. The subject of this research were the students of SMPN 2 Pujon-Kabupaten Malang, that is 30 students in an experimental class (using the developed textbook) and 29 students in a control class (using BSE book from the government). The teaching material was categorized valid if the expert\\'s judgment at least is categorized as “good”. The teaching material was categorized practical if both of teachers and students assessment at least categorized as “good”. The teaching material was categorized effectively if minimum 75% of student scores at least is categorized as “good” for the mathematical reasoning test and mathematical communication test. This research resulted in a valid, practical, and effective teaching material. The resulted of the validation show that material teaching is valid. The resulted of teachers and students assessment show that the product is practical. The tests scores show that the product is effective. Percentage of students who categorized at least as “good” is 83,33% for the mathematical reasoning and 86,67% for the mathematical communication. The resulted of statistic test shows that the product more effective than the BSE book from the government in terms of mathematical reasoning and mathematical communication. This research aims to describe: (1) the quality of mathematics school examination test of the Junior High School for the academic year 2015/2016 in Kabupaten Bangkalan based on qualitative analysis of tests item, (2) ) the quality of mathematics school examination test of Junior High School for the academic year 2015/2016 in Kabupaten Bangkalan based on quantitative analysis of test items, and (3) the test equating on mathematics school examination test for the academic year of 2015/2016 of Junior High School in Kabupaten Bangkalan. A test is said to be quality if it fulfills validity, reliability, and it has good characteristic. A test is said to be equivalent to another if the test scores of one test can be exchanged with the scores of another test. The data is taken from school examination script accompanied with the answer sheets of students. Qualitative data analysis was conducted with the help of experts judgement. Quantitative data analysis was conducted with Classical Test Theory by Iteman and Item Response Theory by BilogMG. These programs are used to find out the test quality quantitatively. In order to analyze the equivalence between series of tests, item-characteristic curves were used. These curves were drawn by Geogebra. The research result shows: (1) qualitatively, the test plan quality of mathematics school examination test is quite good. Meanwhile, the school exam quality is quite good and not so good, (2) quantitatively, the school examination test quality is good, and (3) equating, based on the item-characteristic curves, the school examination tests is equal. This paper reported result of a research attempted to analyze: the increase in student’s MPS and SC using problem-based learning; and to look interaction between students’ PMK and learning to increase student’s MPS and SC. This type of research was a quasi-experimental. The population of this research was all students in SMA Negeri 6 Medan. Then 33 students were chosen as the experimental class and 33 students in other class was chosen as a control class by using purposive sampling technique. The data in this study were analyzed using Two Ways ANOVA. The result of validity of student’s MPS test is 0,808. Both reability of test was 0.86. The result of this research were: (1) The enhancement of student’s MPS ability and SC using problem-based learning was higher than conventional learning; (2) There is no interaction between student’s PMK and learning on student’s MPS ability and SC. This research was aimed to investigate the effect of students’ self-explanation to their achievement, mental effort, and cognitive efficiency while studying mathematics, particularly in integral topics. This research used a static-group comparison design implemented to first-year undergraduate students. The subject of the study consists of 64 first year undergraduate students in one of the universities in Banten province, Indonesia. The students were divided into two classrooms, experimental and control. Experimental classroom received worked-example method whereas control classroom studying without worked-example method. Instruments used in this research include achievement tests, rating scale mental effort, deviation model of cognitive efficiency, and teaching materials in the form of worked-example. The results show that the implementation of self-explanation through worked-example helps\n",
      "10 This paper investigated the impacts of scientific production and insertion in stricto sensu Post-Graduation Programs in the Legal Amazon by graduates of the Amazonian Education Network in Sciences and Mathematics Post-Graduation Program (Programa de Pós-Graduação da Rede Amazônica de Educação em Ciências e Matemática - REAMEC). For such, we ascertained the curricula of twenty-nine graduates of the first class through a Lattes platform in what is constituted as a descriptive, exploratory paper from a quantitative approach. The study shows there has been a significant increase in the production, mainly of chapters of books and publications in journals with Qualis/Capes, in comparison the the period before joining the Program. By February 2017, time of information gathering from the curricula, nine graduates were already registered and working on post-graduation programs. This demonstrates that the Program is being consolidated in the Amazon region with outlook for a growth in research and an increase in the number of Science and Mathematics Teaching Masters Programs. A good classification in the Public-School Mathematics Olympiad (OBMEP) provides students, in addition to medals and honorable mentions, scientific initiation fellowships of the Junior Scientific Initiation (PIC). All this to intent students awaken to the taste and pleasure in studying mathematics and science in general, motivating them in the professional choice of scientific and technological careers. Therefore, was carried out the research project its objective is to analyze the contribution of the use of the Bank of Questions in the preparatory studies for the level 3 exam of the first phase of OBMEP. To this end, with the help of the two fellows, studies were carried out for two hours per week throughout the duration of the project from the perspective of George Pólya\\'s problem solving. Initially, it was inhibited to use the resolutions of the Bank of Questions as an auxiliary to the study and subsequently had the use of it liberated for the questions that had not been resolved. With this study, were compared the results of the exams of 2016 and 2017 carrying out an analysis of these data and showing the vision of the fellows who were also individuals participating in the research. Only recently has the semiotic approach become more acceptable or common in mathematics education research and analysis and has gradually disconcerted the Platonic foundation of mathematical objects. In fact it has become increasingly evident that the meanings of concepts develop in the social relationships. The objective is to present the reasons for the use of the semiotic approach in mathematical education. We are arguing, in fact, that the crystallization of mathematical concepts limits creativity and distances school learning from the day to day practices. In theoretical research, questions are addressed such as What is the x in this equation?, evidencing a part of the work of Frege and Benacerraf, with more appreciation to the Peirce’s Semiotic. Illustrative and important examples of such a perspective are presented. For example, the complementarity between text and diagram offers opportunities of critical reflections about the expected results of education in mathematics. Therefore, to think semiotically is to recognize that all knowledge is dynamic, despite being constructed through signs, implying responsibilities, either in choosing the strategy defined for each problem situation, or in identifying the meanings according to the given references and the interactions with the world.\n",
      "11 The article discusses the content of the military-social work of the Ukraine Armed Forces as a moral and psychological support component. The functions, tasks and content of military-social work are revealed. The understanding of the military-social work content has been supplemented and expanded. A comparative analysis of the social workers and volunteer activities in the Ukraine Armed Forces and the foreign countries armies was carried out.The specialization of the social worker was marked as a complex of social-legal, economic and vigorous calls, conducted by the state, government bodies, commanders and headquarters of all regions, and all of them, member of the group of services. The military social work main tasks are highlighted: protection of social norms and guarantees of military personnel in accordance with existing legislation; implementation of measures to reduce the social tension of military collectives; research of social processes in military collectives; creation of prerequisites for the formation and maintenance of high combat activity of personnel; adaptation of military personnel to changing conditions, work with families of military personnel. The fact that in the Armed Forces of Ukraine military-social work is primarily informational, advisory in nature, rather than the practical implementation of measures to ensure the social protection of the state\\'s military personnel, has been ascertained. The article is devoted the theheoretical model for assessing community needs for social services wich based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of sociological research. The profession of social work should focusing on the identification of community needs and the development of resources to social services. Needs can be identified as the gap between what is determined as a necessary level of resources and what resources actually exist. The ability to examine needs in a systematic way through a needs assessment helps in the identification of what resources are lacking and provides a basis for developing the resources to meet those needs. The K. Neuber defines a needs assessment as \\\"...a systematic process of data collection and analysis as inputs into resource allocation with a view to discovering and identifying goods and services the community is lacking in relation to the generally accepted standards and for which there exists some consensus as to the community\\'s responsibility for their provision\\\". But if we talk about needs in social work, we should remember Sopko R.I. and her work \\\"Typology of Client Needs in Social Work\\\" where she identifies four types of client needs in social work: a) Regulatory need, b) Need felt, c) Need expressed, d) Relative (comparative) need. The proposed theheoretical model for assessing community needs for social services has 3 stages: 1) researching of the expressed need – analysis of statistical data on the social structure of the population of the community and existing providers of social services; 2) researching of relative need – analysis of the quality of social services provided in the community; 3) result of needs assessment – analysis of the ratio of the level of satisfaction of expressed and relative needs. The article analyses the essence of the concept of \\\"interest\\\". It is analysed the way new social shifts and changes provoke new organizational forms. It is illustrated that merging into new organizational forms is happening on a new basis. Most often, interest appears in scientific research as emotion, intention, concernment, desire, and activity stimulus. In Soviet psychological science, the concept of interest was identified with the concept of cognitive need. Such needs are distinguished as saturated and unsaturated. This characteristic most clearly illustrates the difference between need and interest. Interest has an unsaturated basis; it is not aimed at producing a specific result. Interest can remain the same during the life, or the realization of one interest turns to the realization of the next one. Interests can transform over time, but it is not a transformation of interest itself – it is the transformation of the Self-Concept of the individual. It is presented that interest is always conscious and rational in its essence. The emergence of interest is irrational, it always appears spontaneously. It has been researched that interest is always the result of activity. Interest opens the field of possibilities in the implementation of ideas. Social changesare different in nature. If they bring a new idea, then such an idea corresponds tothe interests, not to the needs. If social changesare dictated by unmet basic needs, then we have a social uprising (revolution).There is no social activity without interest. The space where interests prevail is the space of social change. Supporting \\\"otherness\\\" in social terms gives impetus to development and social shifts. The emergence of scientific and creative communities illustrates how the transition from need to interest changes the world around us. The article highlights the problem of the absence of an inclusive environment for people with disabilities as a factor in the declarative nature of inclusive reforms. Actual barriers and problems that prevent people with disabilities from participating actively in society are described. These barriers require an integrated approach to develop practical solution and minimize them. Pedagogical aspect of terms \\\"inclusion\\\" and \\\"inclusive environment\\\" is the most developed (right now). Nevertheless, the main idea of the pedagogical concept of inclusion is the creation of a \\\"school for all\\\" that meets the common European standards and the mission of creating a society for all. So the idea of inclusivity at this point has a broader meaning than simply creating the right environment at school. The key elements of social and pedagogical aspects are recognition of diversity, elimination of inequalities, minimization of barriers and creation of conditions in which any exclusion in all spheres of life is impossible. Psychological aspect of inclusion is to understand psychological well-being as an important element of it. Psychological conditions of an inclusive environment should contribute to the individual\\'s experience of subjective well-being. Based on the etymology of the word, you can describe inclusion as the process of forming a single whole by combining different parts. Having analyzed the social, pedagogical and psychological aspects of defining this concept, we believe that it is only whole environment in which inclusion must be realized. Thus, an inclusive environment is a human environment that provides conditions for inclusion of all persons into the spheres of society through the elimination of any barriers, taking into account the diversity of people. The integrated concept gives the opportunity to scientifically substantiate the design of new projects, programs and creation of inclusive social services. The author investigates the transformation processes of family values, preconditions that have influenced the emergence of the familism in Hungarian society. The article deals with the analysis of the main characteristics of neo-familism as the dominant social phenomenon of the present, which directly impacts the Hungarian family policy and determines the further direction of the family support system formation. It has been noted that familism is a complex concept and can be interpreted from different perspectives. This term is revealed through the prism of personal and family values, norms, interpersonal and social relations, as well as governance systems strategies. In this article, familism is discussed mainly as a system of governance measures, disclosed through the demonstration of social, in particular, family policy strategies, as well as instruments of its regulation. Hungarian family policy and the effects of familism on it are described and analysed in several characteristics, such as types of financial support, supporting measures to facilitate parents\\' participation in the labour market and the social services systems. It is proved that, in comparison with other European Union countries, the parental support system of childcare in Hungary is one of the most comprehensive. On the basis of the analysis, it has been concluded that the Hungarian family support system was formed under the influence of the consequences of historical events and political ideologies. The key factors, which are determining the direction of the system transformation today, are both post-socialism and Europeanisation at the same time. The analysis of the historical preconditions of the family policy formation and its modern regulatory instruments classifies the Hungarian support system as optional familism, which provides universal financial support to families, a comprehensive system of parental leave and childcare allowances, tax deductions, public nursery and kindergarten services. The author also underlines the significance of analysing the Hungarian welfare system and social services which support not only families in difficult life circumstances but also middle-class families. The article is devoted to the study of psychological factors that can influence upon personal motivation and readiness for charity of adolescent. The findings can help to increase the effectiveness of programs that involve young people in charity and identify the most effective methods to form prosocial behavior of young people aimed at helping and supporting others in the long run. The purpose of the article is to investigate the influence of personal, pedagogical and socio-psychological factors on the formation of young people\\'s readiness for charitable activity. The author analyzed the potential positive consequences of prosocial activity for adolescents, identified the main motives of charity and the specific motivation of high school students, summarized information about the factors and mechanisms of involvement and formation of charitable readiness. Analysis of the data obtained in the empirical study of adolescents from two schools with different pedagogical environment and different levels of organization of school prosocial activity, allowed to identify a number of patterns that indicate the dominant factors in the formation of adolescents readiness for charity. We have found that altruism, empathy and the dominance of values of universalism, goodness and conformity are significant personal characteristics that determine the readiness for charitable activity. Significant personal factors are polymotivation (the combination of personal and social motives for charitable activities), a high level of involvement in such activities and the availability of certain experiences. We have found that the most important environments for development of charity readiness are the family and the school. The immediate environment (project team) and the authority of the mentor, the possibility of self-realization, the reach of the result, the opportunity to receive positive emotions, the level of responsibility play a significant role in increasing the level of involvement in school projects and programs. In a school where teachers attach great importance to the prosocial activity of students in the educational process, the impact of the school environment becomes major. It determines the readiness for further charity both with the family and as a part of extracurricular activities. We have considered approaches to define the concept \\\"inclusive education\\\". We have defined features of the communication between elder school children in the inclusive environment. Found that communication and perception of children with special needs depend much on disability form because kids with physical disabilities can more easy socialize, they are perceived better in the peer community, they are more communicated and interacted. It is proved that children\\'s attitude to classmates with disabilities depends on attitude of their parents to the inclusiveness and inclusive environment. We have defined, that for successful introducing inclusive education and creating a comfortable environment for all we have to work directly with parents so that they understand that introducing an inclusive environment will not harm their children, but will form their tolerance skills for children with disabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to provide parents with an understanding of the features of children with disabilities, through lectures, trainings, and viewing films about inclusive education. Further directions for exploring effective ways of presenting information on inclusive education for children and parents are perspective, which will help to eliminate stereotypes and establish active communication in an inclusive environment. The article deals with the issues of the formation and development of social pedagogy in the field of social work and the perspectives for its further development, because in the today\\'s conditions, in accordance with the priority vectors of the state social policy, social-pedagogical work with various social groups is significantly intensified. The purpose of the article is to analyze the development of socio-pedagogical work in Ukraine and offer vectors of its perspectives. An analysis of theoretical and methodological approaches to the characteristics of such paradigms\n",
      "12 This study examined some haematological and serum biochemical Indices of broiler chickens fed Polyalthia longifolia leaf meal (PLM) as partial replacement of wheat offal. A total number of 250 broiler chickens were used in the experiment which lasted for 8 weeks. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the mixture of graded levels of Moringaoleifera and Ipomea batata Leaves Meal MOIBLM on the growth performance carcass quality as well as haematology and serum biochemical indices of broiler chickens. A total of one hundred and eighty 180 day old Arbo acre broiler chickens were randomly allotted into four dietary treatments of forty five 45 birds each in a Completely Randomized Experimental Design CRD.&nbsp; Using annual time series data on the prevalence of anemia in children under 5 years of age in Yemen from 1990 – 2016, the study makes predictions for the period 2017 – 2025. The study applies the Box-Jenkins ARIMA methodology. The diagnostic ADF tests show that, AG, the series under consideration is an I (0) variable. Based on the AIC, the study presents an AR (3) process, the ARIMA (3, 0, 0) model as the optimal model. The diagnostic tests further prove that the presented model is stable and its residuals are not serially correlated. The results of the study indicate that the prevalence of anemia in children in The Gambia is projected to slightly rise over the out-of-sample period by approximately 1.2%. This implies that the prevalence of anemia in children under the age of five in The Gambia will remain very high. Believe it or not, any dog is capable of biting. Dog bites can cause serious injuries and even death, especially to humans. This piece of work uses monthly time series data on dog bite cases recorded and managed at Gweru Provincial Hospital (GPH) from Janaury 2010 to December 2019, to predict dysentery cases over the period January 2019 to December 2020. The study applied the ANN (12, 12, 1) model. Residual analysis of this model indicates that the model is stable and adequate and therefore suitable for predicting dog bite cases at GPH over the out-of-sample period. The results of the study reveal that dog bite cases may slightly rise over the out-of-sample period. The study, amongst other policy directions, recommends Mass Dog Vaccination (MDV) as well as educating people about dogs in the GPH catchment area in order to reduce the numbers of dog bites as well as the negative heath impacts of this preventable public health concern. As a result of studying the amount and species composition of collembolas in 0- 30 cm layers of soils of wheat and cotton agrocenoses in Shovot district Khorezm region, which is located in the north of Uzbekistan, it was found that there there are 14 species of collembolas belong to 5 families and 13 genera. The use of plants or natural products have recently gained global interest due to the increasing awareness on the dangers of synthetic drugs and chemicals in terms of its adverse affect and anticipated toxicity, plants have played vital roles in bridging the gap between food safety and livestock production; they are cheap, effective and safe due to the presence of phytochemicals or bioactive chemicals, therefore this study was carried out to examine the proximate, phytochemical and vitamin compositions of Prosopis aficana stem bark (PAD). Proximate analysis revealed the presence of moisture (8.35 %), dry matter (91.65 %), crude protein (4.87 %), crude fibre (45.60 %), ether extract (0.81 %), ash (11.52 %) and carbohydrates (28.85 %). Phytochemical screening of PAD showed that it contained hydrolysable tannins, condensed tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, phenols, phytic acid and oxalates at 3.33 %, 0.17 %, 5.45 %, 9.83 %, 2.10 %, 1.82 %, 4.02 %, 0.78 % and 0.85 % respectively. PAD contained ?-carotene (1.51 mg/100g), vitamin B1 (0.33 mg/100g), vitamin B2 (0.94 mg/100g), vitamin B3 (0.42 mg/100g), vitamin B6 (0.20 mg/100g), vitamin B9 (0.18 mg/100g), vitamin B12 (0.88 mg/100g), vitamin C (4.22 mg/100g), vitamin D (0.12 mg/100g) and vitamin K (0.21 mg/100g). It was concluded that PAD is loaded with nutrients and phytochemicals which confers them the ability to perform multiple biological activities and are also precursors for the synthesis of useful drugs. Compost is a simple way of creating what scientists call a positive feedback loop. This study was conducted to determine the pH, N, P, and moisture content; the number of days to decomposition; the percent recovery of composted substrates; and the return on cash expense of producing the formulated sunflower-based compost. The substrates used in the study were wild sunflower, grass, alnus leaves and banana bract. These were composted until it becomes recognizable. The grass, alnus leaves, and banana bract are constant in weight which is 10 kg each, only the sunflower varied in rate. Different rates of wild sunflower in the treatments were the following: T1=10 kg, T2=20 kg, T3=30 kg, T4=40 kg and T5=50 kg. Results showed that chemical and moisture contents of formulated wild sunflower-based compost were not affected by the different rates of wild sunflower except N. Treatment 4 (4:1:1:1 of wild sunflower, grass, alnus leaves and banana bract) obtained the highest N content with 3.21 %. The lowest was registered from the formulation of 1:1:1:1 of wild sunflower, grass, alnus leaves and banana bract (T1) with 2.21 %. The higher the rate of wild sunflower, the early and the higher are the number of days to decompose and the percentage of its recovery, respectively. Treatment 5 (5:1:1:1 of wild sunflower, grass, alnus leaves and banana bract) gained a higher return on cash expense with 13.05 %. India is the second largest producer of fruits in the world after China followed by Brazil. A large variety of fruits are grown in India. Mango is most widely grown fruit crop in India with a share of 34.71 percent in area and 22.41 percent share in production. An attempt has been made in this paper to analyse the production and export of mangoes from India. It has been found from the study that India holds the first rank in area and production of mangoes in the world with 41.25 percent share in global area under mango cultivation and 40.38 percent share in global production of mangoes. The area, production and productivity of mango in India displayed compound annual growth rate of 4.45 percent, 5.55 percent and 1.05 percent between 20001-02 and 2017- 18respectfully. Furthermore, it is found from the study that total quantity of mango exported displayed negative compound annual growth rate of 2.42 percent while as total value of mango exported recorded remarkable compound annual growth rate of 7.63 percent between 2012-13 and 2017-18. The major export market for Indian mangoes is U.A.E with percentage share of 58.71 to total export value followed by U.K. (9.45 percent) and Saudi Arabia (5.09 percent). The Black Sea is one of the largest inland continental seas. It can be posed an ecological problem by the rivers that flow into it. Rivers can pollute with large amounts of biogenic substances and various organic pollutants. Therefore, the study of the ecological status of rivers is crucial (Mchedluri., T. 2020) The aim of our research was to determine the ecological status of the sediments of the rivers of the Black Sea basin of Georgia, Natanebi and Choloki. For this purpose, studies were conducted in the summer of 2020 and its hydrochemical parameters were evaluated. Physico-chemical parameters of water (pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen in the water, odor, and turbidity) were determined in the analytical samples. Some heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Zn, Al, Ni, Cr, Mn, As), basic ions (HCO3 – , Cl– , Ca2+ , Mg2 +, Na + , K + , SO4 2– ). Samples were taken, packaged and transported in accordance with ISO and EPA standards. Based on the results of the study, we can conclude that the basic ions in water do not exceed the maximum permissible concentrations. The content of heavy metals in the floating sediments of the river Natanebi is significantly increased compared to the bottom sediments. Presumably, these elements are accumulated in the terrigenous material generated by the washing of the soil surface. The hydro-chemical characteristics of the Natanebi River and the Choloki River are close to each other. In the downstream of the Natanebi River, all the studied features are practically within the background and no obvious ecological problems occur. As for the river Cholokhi, it is possible to show signs of eutrophication in it, which will be caused by natural conditions, due to the gentle flow of the parallel riverbed. At present, the anthropogenic pollution of rivers does not reach dangerous levels and their ecological condition is satisfactory The article presents data on the influence of agrotechnical measures on the harmfulness of cotton bollworm in tobacco agrobiocenosis in Uzbekistan. This article describes the influence of the forms and rates of phosphorus fertilizers on the corn yield in the unwashed and washed off typical gray soils of the Zerafshan Valley. Studies have shown that when cultivating corn for grain, on non-washed-out soils, the optimal rate of fertilizers N240P120K100 was determined with a grain yield of 6.82 t/ha, for washed away - N240P150K100 and a grain yield of 5.81 t/ha.\n",

      "14 The growth of the Peruvian migration to Buenos Aires is a phenomenon highlighted in the last decades. From a gender perspective, the configuration of the nets is studied in the pre-migration stage, as well as its later composition and distribution in Argentina. Secondary sources are used, but the main contribution comes given by the «Peruvian Migration and Gender Survey» (EMIGE 2007). Main results: it is the migratory flow with smaller antiquity in Argentina. In a high proportion, they concentrate on the City of Buenos Aires and they constitute the foreign population with bigger pre-eminence of women and the less aged one. With regard to premigration stage, the study shows that the migration networks are conditioned by the gender system, but that relationship varies along the process that goes from the decision taking to the concretion of the movement, in function of the vital/familiar stage lived by who wants to move. To make a wish. Educational and occupational aspirations in two generations of rural children, in Ayacucho (Peru) This paper presents a genealogy of educational and occupational aspirations, based on the desires of two generations of rural children of Ayacucho. Taking the region’s recent turbulent and violent history into account, and other recent structural social changes, the research shows how the aspirations change between both generations, paying special attention to gender differences. Terciary education becomes the most wanted future, while peasant activities almost disappear from desired future lives; in addition, in poorer households girls keep higher aspirations than their male peers. Despite all this, hard evidence shows that tertiary education is rarely reached in Ayacucho, and women still have less opportunity to access and finish secondary and tertiary education. Therefore, this genealogy of desires not only should be seen as a social construction, but also as an expression of voice and agency, where social hierarchies are questioned. About special indigenous representation in Peru: An approach from the viewpoint of indigenous leaders. Following the numerous indigenous uprisings in the 1990´s, scholars have paid close attention to indigenous politics in Latin America, with their main focus placed on the construction of indigenous movements, as well as indigenous identity. In contrast, very few contributions deal with institutional designs to promote indigenous people’s access to formal politics. This paper addresses the topic of descriptive representation of indigenous people in formal decision-making spheres, with the main focus on the Parliament. It outlines the benefits associated with descriptive representation of minorities, as well as two cases of interest: Mexico and New Zealand. Based on interviews conducted during the summer of 2009, the article provides insight into the indigenous leaders´ assessments regarding this issue. It also includes a look at the magnitude of recent indigenous representation in Parliament. The final section presents a brief review of some strategies to include indigenous people informal power structures. This article analyzes the theoretical and epistemological elaborations of Luhmann about the problem of meaning. Its aim is to trace the key tension that crosses the different inflections of his proposal: between a formal definition of meaning, with the distinction of selective actuality and the horizon of potentialities, and its taking form, parting from the operations of systems. In order to do this, three decisive moments of his perspective are studied. First, the article focuses on his claim to formally conceptualize and to «desubjectivize» meaning, within a series of theoretical inheritances and ruptures.Second, it analyzes the consequences of his autopoietical proposal, either by pointing out meaning as the coevolutionary achievement of psychic and social systems, or in its analysis of the linguistic generalization of meaning. Third, in his later works, with the intensification of his theory of the observer, the article examines his approach to meaning from the distinction between medium and form. Finally, the previous considerations are combined with his theory of evolution and differentiation of society, from which the article reflects on the particularities of the conceptual construction of Luhmann about meaning. This paper proposes a situated reflection on the political potential of the concept of those environmentally affected, in a framework of fight for rights, in order to promote a dense conceptualization, according to the situations of suffering and violations suffered by victims of environmental pollution. First we describe an experience rich in examples, highlighting the institutional set of the injustices andthose devices of mis-recognition. Also we describe the communities formed by and for the victims. Secondly, we make a review of some contexts of use of the notion of environmental affected that can contribute to strength —in the particular case analyzed and by extension, to others— for a public and political self-understanding towards effective recognition. This article attempts to observe the existence of certain similarities between trust that can be established between individuals and their local political institution, with habitual ways of relating that adjoin political clientelism. Certain similarities that point to question whether clientelism can be accommodated as a way to build relationships, create links and bring the individual to the political institution. The local political institution will be studied, and observe how relations have been builtin two districts of the same geographical area, through qualitative and quantitative tools. It will be noted that the usual way of relating learned still present and mobilizes the ways of acting individuals; therefore links with clientelistic characteristics are plausible to generate trust relationships. This article describes the main tests faced by individuals belonging to the middle classes in Cali, in the framework of its relations of friendship and couple. These challenges that affect different areas of your personal life, work and family are part of the relational dynamics that characterized such groups and that are the product of the economic, political and cultural transformations that have characterized the recent history of Colombian society. Specialized literature associates attitudes considered important to guarantee democratic legitimacy, such as political participation willingness with citizens’ self-recognition of their potential to influence the public sphere. As well, it emphasizes that increasing formal years of study, particularly higher education, as influential on the development of such attitude, also known as internal political effectiveness.I propose to analyze the educational mechanisms that could explain this relationship; questioning for the Peruvian context if accumulating years in higher education would be enough to understand it. Through multiple regression models, and using the data of a survey applied to Peruvian students from a private university, this article seeks to identify if having more semesters in university would be an influencing factor on higher levels of internal political efficacy or if the experience in a course aimed at challenging students about their citizenship would be more relevant. The results indicate, for the sample selected, that the latest would have a positive and significant effect on their self-recognition as subjects of power from a democratic perspective; unlike the number of accumulated academic semesters. Peru does not have an articulated and organized student movement that promote clear agendas to improve the quality of higher education. Still, students compete in elections for seats at their university’s governing bodies. This is the case of the National University of Peruvian Amazon (UNAP), where student’s political groups have increased in recent years without a clear agenda about university development. This article explores this paradox describing the new mobilizers for students’ organizations.Firstly, the findings suggest that university’s governing bodies operate under a clientelistic logic between students and authorities. However, at the same time some students have built a new interest in local and regional politics as a result of the Peruvian decentralization process. Therefore, student organizations are also functioning as political operators and supporters of the regional movements.The “big politics” continue to intervene in “petty politics”, and vice versa, turning the university into a relevant arena and students into key actors to understand subnational politics and the functioning of “democracies without parties”. The article analyzes the involvement of seven university students in drug dealing in Metropolitan Lima. This qualitative study based its analysis on semi-structured interviews and seven-month fieldwork.The article evidences that the experience as recreational drug users allows them to grasp basic routines related to the market: who, where and how to buy drugs. Based on that previous experience, students get involved in marijuana exchanges because: (i) they want to sell it in order to smoke for free; (ii) they have a good connection with and become a broker for their friends, or (iii) they are interested in generating extra-money to maintain a lifestyle associated with recreational consumption in middle-class university contexts (going to parties, going on trips, buying other drugs, among others).Subsequently, students emphasize their interest in generating monetary incomes and begin to sell marijuana more frequently and in greater quantities. This escalation does not lead to the development of and identity as a ‘drug-dealer’, nor an involvement in other criminal activities. This research aims to show the organizational changes and forms of social intervention that have been assumed by NGOs that were founded in Peru between the 60s and 80s. Since 1990 these NGOs have undergone a series of changes, mainly these have been given in the development discourses that guide their projects, in the type of relations that they establish with key actors to execute them and in the way to finance their operation. It will be noted that in the field of international and local development the rules of the game for NGOs are modified: the central State and the business sector acquire a greater presence in the promotion of development projects; There is a greater orientation to the market and selling services based on efficient management; And there is a context of reduction of funds coming from international cooperation agencies. This will generate the emergence of strategic roles as a way to respond to these changes in the institutional environment. It will be noted that, although strategies have been modified and new approaches are used - linked to human development, gender, environment, governance, among others - the meaning of NGOs’ foundational social action remain in force: working with vulnerable and excluded populations.\n",
      "15 The authors consider the application of biophysical techniques in the study of cosmetics effectiveness. The quality of a cosmetic product includes the safety of its use, the formulation stability , the visual and other sensorial aspects, and its effectiveness. The biophysical techniques have been widely used in the evaluation of the effect of formulations of topical use, mainly due to the fact of facilitating the evaluation of products in its real use conditions, that is to say, directly in the human skin. The confirmation of the effects of cosmetic products and its action mechanism, by means of experimental protocols properly elaborated using the skin biophysics is of fundamental importance. It should be thoroughly explored and quite developed seeking the improvement of the life quality of users of such products. Dietary fibers are defined as the component of the plants or analog carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small bowel. The America Dietetic Association recommends an ingestion of 20-30g of fiber per day. Evidences suggest that a diet rich in fibers brings benefits to health maintenance, by reducing the risk and the time of treatment of chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diverticulitis and diabetes. Fibers are classified as a soluble and insoluble with distinct physiological effects. Ingestion of insoluble fibers increases the fecal bolus and reduces the transit time of food through the bowel. Soluble fibers delay gastric emptying and glucose absorption reducing the post prandial glycemia and reduce blood cholesterol levels due to a physic characteristic that confers viscosity to the luminal content. Beta-glucans are highly viscous and their consumption has been related to the attenuation of post-prandial glycemic and insulin response. Dietary beta-glucans have impact on starch degradation and carbohydrates availability and consequently at the glycemic index of the ingested food. Consumption of beta-glucans is recommended aiming to modulate the glycemia and the insulin needs, to manage the obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. This paper brings information about dietary fibers and the use of beta-glucans on the treatment of diabetes. &#949; -Caprolactam (CAP) is a precursor monomer of nylon 6 polymers. Nylon 6 is used in the manufacture of carpets, clothes and plastic materials, such as equipment, systems and automotive components, connectors and plastic packaging. CAP residues can migrate from nylon 6 plastic packaging to foods. Given this fact, this review was realized concerning the effects of CAP exposure and its impact on human health. Epidemiological studies indicate that CAP could cause ocular, cutaneous and respiratory irritations, as well as hypotension, tachycardia, palpitations, rhinorrhea, nose dryness, neurological and blood problems, and genitourinary and reproductive effects, such as alterations in ovarian-menstrual functions and pregnancy/birth complications. Animal studies are consistent with such reports; however, the majority of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies by oral and intraperitoneal routes show negative results, including the absence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice and developmental and reproductive effects in rats and rabbits. The Brazilian Health Care System stimulated for restrictive economic contexts had passed for reorganization in the decade of 1990, directed mainly to the primary attention. Although the reforms, the incidence of diabetes mellitus still reaches epidemic levels. The diabetes prevention has become actual preoccupation due the high morbimortality that accompanies this disease, becoming necessary the development of efficient and viable programs for Brazilian Public Health system such as emphasis in the primary prevention, control of the diseases incidence and complications. To obtain this goal, the current model of attention given to the patient must be modified, prioritizing the primary attention and a replacement of the hegemonic medical model for another one, formed by an interdisciplinary team, where the pharmacist as a member could offer his/her services should occur, thus minimizing social, humanistic and economic impacts that the diabetes causes for the society. The aim of this present revision is to approach the diabetes mellitus, the difficulties for its control associated with the adopted ineffective system, mainly in the Brazilian Public Health System. The objective of this work was to validate the spectrophotometric method to detect and quantify nitrite using ham pate as a source. The validated analytical conditions were 540 nm wavelength and the samples reading between 40 to 70 minutes after addition of coloring agents. The tested performance criteria were: linearity, matrix effect, selectivity, detection and quantification limit, accuracy, precision and robustness. As the results have obtained linearity in the studied zone (0.125 to 3 g/mL) and matrix effect was not observed, there was not any interference from ascorbic acid, but interference occurred from sodium eritorbate, in concentrations above 2.5 mg/100g. The detection limit was defined as 12.5 mg of nitrite/kg for pate and the quantification limit as 25 mg of nitrite/kg of pate. The method presented repeatability and reproducibility. The accuracy was assessed through recovery values varying from 84 to 110%. Respecting robustness, it was observed that the variations applied to the extraction procedure depended on the concentration of nitrite in the pate sample. In conclusion, the methodology was validated under the tested conditions. This work aimed to identify medicines whose form or pharmaceutical formula presents a problem to pediatrics (Problem Medication - PM), the strategies employed by doctors to use them in children, and the potential risks involved. Descriptive study: based on a survey with pediatricians from a SUS (Public Health System) reference hospital in Fortaleza-CE (Northeastern Brazil), in order to identify PMs, from July to August 2004; an analysis of prescriptions containing modification of medicines in the solid forms; and a follow-up of medicinal preparations, developed in December 2004 and January 2005, respectively. The medications were grouped by an anatomic, therapeutic and chemical classification and by means of a calculation of variables frequency. The pediatricians (N=48, 98% of the total) identified as PMs: 16 products without an injectable form; 32 in an injectable form that should be presented in lesser concentrations; and 30 without a liquid formula for oral use. Eighty two (82) prescriptions containing modifications of solid forms, involving 111 medicinal items were analyzed, all of which contained inadequacies; the main one being the partition of pills. In 33.6% of the cases, the prescribed doses were in accordance with that generally recommended. The modifications were carried out in inadequate places, by nonqualified professionals and without the use of best practices. The lack of appropriate formulae for pediatric use has an impact on medical practices. It is aggravated by the lack of appropriate conditions for medicines manipulation by pharmacists, in Brazilian hospitals, and this impact involves risks to patients. Meloxicam is a broadly used drug in the therapeutics for the osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treatments in adults, and it is available in the Brazilian market, as tablet and capsule pharmaceutical forms. The present work aimed to establish conditions for accomplishment of the dissolution test of 15 mg meloxicam tablets (A and B test products), compared with the reference product, since there is no monograph about dissolution assays for meloxicam in official summaries. To optimize the conditions several parameters were tested and, according to obtained results, the use of pH 7.5 phosphate buffer (900mL, at 37 ± 0.5ºC) as dissolution medium, paddle method (apparatus 2), stirring speed of the dissolution medium at 100 rpm and collect time of 60 minutes were considered satisfactory. The samples were quantified by UV spectrophotometric method at 362 nm. The products presented kinetics of first-order. Dissolution efficiency values were of 83.25, 83.73 and 88.10% for the A, B and reference products, respectively. Factors f1 and f2 were calculated and similarity of the tested medicines was demonstrated. The dissolution test was validated presenting selectivity, linearity, precision and accuracy within of the acceptance criteria. The identification of Baccharis spp. which have cladodes, defined as winged stems, brings difficulties even for taxonomists. Baccharis microcephala and B. trimera belong to the Trimera group and are known as carquejas. In folk medicine, it is common the use of winged species for the same therapeutic indication, such as diuretic, hepatoprotective and digestive. The monograph of B. trimera is included in the F. Bras. IV and this species shows anti-inflammatory, analgesic, bacteriostatic, bactericidal and antidiabetic activities. The species B. trimera and B. microcephala are alike and used by the population for the same therapeutic purposes. This work has aimed to study the external morphology and anatomy of the cladodes of these species, in order to contribute to the quality control of phytotherapic agents, as well as supply information for the taxonomic group. The botanical material was prepared for light and scanning electron microtechniques. Both species are three-winged, although the stem wings are narrow and nearly continuous in B. microcephala while in B. trimera they are wider and interrupted. The morphological characters and mainly the non-glandular trichomes allow these species to be distinguished. A simple, rapid, accurate and sensitive method was developed for quantitative analysis of dexamethasone acetate in microemulsions using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. The chromatography parameters were stainless steel Lichrospher 100 RP-18 column (250 mm x 4 mm i.d., 5 &#956;m particle size), at 30 ± 2 ºC. The isocratic mobile phase was methanol:water (65:35; v/v) at a flow rate of at 1.0 mL.min-1. The determinations were performed using UV-Vis detector set at 239 nm. Samples were prepared with methanol and the volume injected was 20 &#956;L. The analytical curve was linear (r² 0.9995) over a wide concentration range (2.0-30.0 &#956;g.mL-1). The presence of components of the microemulsion did not interfere in the results of the analysis. The method showed adequate precision, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) smaller than 3%. The accuracy was analyzed by adding a standard drug and good recovery values were obtained for all drug concentrations used. The HPLC method developed in this study showed specificity and selectivity with linearity in the working range and good precision and accuracy, making it very suitable for quantification of dexamethasone in microemulsions. The analytical procedure is reliable and offers advantages in terms of speed and low cost of reagents. With the aim of producing wheat flour with low phenylalanine (Phe) content to be introduced in phenylketonuric\\'s diet, the proteins were enzymaticaly extracted, using an alkaline protease from Bacillus licheniformis. Then, the protein extracts were hydrolyzed by the action of commercial enzymes (pancreatin and bromelain) and of enzymatic extracts obtained from pineapple peel (crude and purified). Some enzymatic parameters were evaluated, such as type of enzyme, type of enzyme action, type of enzymatic association and order of enzyme action. The activated carbon (AC) was used as adsorbent and the efficiency of Phe removal was evaluated by second derivative spectrophotometry measuring the Phe content in wheat flour and in their hydrolysates after AC treatment. The best result was found for the successive association of crude extract followed by pancreatin obtaining 66.28% of removal and a final Phe content of 522.44 mg/100 g of hydrolysate. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radical species have been implicated in initiating or accompanying many diseases in living organisms; there is thus, a continual need for antioxidants molecules to inactivate ROS/free radicals. Many studies of plants crude extracts have demonstrated free-radical scavenging and antioxidant action. Salacia species have long been used, in several countries, as traditional medicines against certain diseases and for their anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, Salacia campestris Walp (Hippocrateaceae) root bark ethanol extract (ScEtOH) was assessed for its ability to scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen species; the results were expressed as percentage inhibition of the active species. ScEtOH was efficient against studied species: DPPH radical (obtained inhibition = 30%), ABTS+ (IC50 = 1.8±0.8 &#956;g/mL), HOCl (IC50 = 1.7 ± 0.1 &#956;g/mL), O2- (obtained inhibition = 32%), and NO (obtained inhibition = 18 %). Peroxidase activity inhibition was evaluated through the guaiacol oxidation reaction catalyzed by hemin, HRP and myeloperoxidase (MPO); data showed that ScEtOH at 10 &#956;g/mL led to 54 and 51% of inhibition, respectively, for the hemin and HRP systems. In the MPO system, ScEtOH promoted a 50% inhibition at 8.9 &#956;g/mL, whereas quercetin, a powerful MPO inhibitor, inhibited this system at 1.35 &#956;g/mL.\n",
      "16 Nitrogen (N) is the most relevant nutrient for wheat crop productivity. In addition, it can affect the commercial and industrial quality of the grain because it affects the hectolitric weight (PH) and the content of protein and gluten. On the other hand, sometimes sulphur (S) can also be a limiting factor. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the response of the wheat crop to different levels of nitrogen-sulfur fertilization in a lot located in Monte Maíz, Province of Córdoba. The variables analyzed were yield and its components, PH, humid gluten (GH) and protein. Four treatments were performed with different doses of N and S, and one unfertilized control. A greater yield was observed with the increase of the dose, associated to a greater number of grains per unit of surface. The quality of the grain, in relation to the unfertilized control, improved with the increase of the dose: the PH, the protein content and the GH increased from 1 to 4%, from 5 to 10% and from 2 to 6% respectively. The fertilization, in the range used in this trial, allowed to increase the economic result of the crop due to the higher yield and better quality of the obtained grain. In the absence of a practical and precise method for estimating pre-harvest yield of graniferous sorghum, it was proposed that such a procedure be developed. Samples of pan leaves from 23 graniferous sorghum hybrids were analyzed in which the correlations between different morphological variables and the weight of the grains contained in them were studied. The morphological variables evaluated were the diameter of the peduncle (DPP), the length (LP) and the width (AP) of the panicle. It was concluded that by means of a simple linear regression and using the DPP or the average AP of a sample of at least 50 panojas as the regressor variable, an accurate estimation of the weight of the grains in the panicle can be made. The microbiological safety of ready-to-eat vegetables lies in the quality of the raw material, the efficiency of washing, disinfection and the control of cross-contamination during the production chain. The objective of this work was to achieve an optimized protocol for the elaboration of rocket ready for consumption to be used by different companies in the province of Cordoba. The proposals made to the company, after the microbiological evaluation of the critical points of the process, were the hygienization of the water reservoir, the decrease of the temperature of the washing and rinsing water and the correction of the pH of the chlorinated water used as disinfectant. The implementation of the proposed changes resulted in an improvement in the microbiological quality of the final product and an optimized procedure protocol that can be implemented in other companies with similar characteristics. The feasibility of predicting the response to phosphorus (P) application is a critical step in the design of a phosphate fertilization plan. Prediction begins with soil analysis. There is no substitute for accurate and reliable soil analysis. However, the way sampling is performed, the analytical technique used, the location of fertilizer in previous campaigns, changes in the orientation of planting lines and even the stratification generated by direct seeding limit the accuracy and reliability of the measured P value. Hence the importance of knowing these factors to include them within the criteria or guidelines to be considered when making the diagnosis of phosphorous fertility. Lippia integrifolia (Griseb.) Hieron. \\\"Incayuyo\\\" is an aromatic, subleñoso shrub that grows in the northwest and center of Argentina. Decoction of its leaves and flowers is traditionally used for digestive tract disorders (Bonzani et al., 2003; Barboza et al., 2006). Its choleretic, antispasmodic (Gorzalczany et al., 2008), biocide in vitro assays on Trypanosoma cruci (Sülsen et al., 2006), antibacterial through chloroformic extracts, on bacteria of medical interest such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Coronel et al., 2006), 2003), larvicide on Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito larvae (Bonino, 2009), in addition the non-stick properties of aqueous extracts of \\\"incayuyo\\\" were identified against the main inducer of gastritis, the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (Marcial et al., 2014) It is used in aperitif drinks and compound weeds (Juliani et al., 2007). The species can be spread both asexually or agamically and sexually. This paper presents a synthesis of the ex situ, circa situ and in situ conservation activity carried out by the National Prosopis Germplasm Bank (BNGP) for 34 years. Among the ex situ conservation actions, the genetic diversity currently stored in the Base Bank, the results of the evaluation of the longevity of the germplasm and the living collections and the field trials installed by the BNGP are made known. Among the circa situ and in situ conservation activities are described the Seed Producing Areas (SPAs) recently certified by INASE in Córdoba, at the request of the BNGP, for the provision of high quality forest seed. In the University City of Cordoba, Argentina, organic waste is recycled from the maintenance of green areas from 2012, and canteens from 2015. The first ones (Chip) are chopped and stowed during several months. Organic waste (Vegetables) is mixed with Chip, in a ratio of 1:2 v/v, and composted. This recycling reduces economic and environmental costs, generates valuable products and serves as didactic material for students of Gardening and Floriculture of the FCA-UNC. The chemical, physical and maturity characterization of the two products obtained shows that a product of good agronomic quality is obtained, but for different uses. Both have low salt content and alkaline pH. The physical characteristics are similar, except for the granulometry, which is finer in compost. According to the data obtained the compost (Chip + Vegetables) is considered suitable for substrate. The Chip could only be used in more diluted proportions, as an amendment. Actions to improve efficiency are suggested. The objective of the work was to develop a procedure to obtain a bio-film type film made from degreased peanut flour (HMD) in order to be used in the elaboration of a package that serves to preserve the quality of foods susceptible to oxidative deterioration, thus prolonging the shelf life of these products. Peanut flour obtained from blanched raw peanut kernels was used in the preparation of the films. The films were prepared according to the following composition: 95% distilled water, 4% HMD and 1% glycerol. For the packages, 19 cm × 9 cm and 9 cm × 9 cm pieces were cut and heat sealed. The films were used to produce food products: (a) sunflower seeds that were roasted at 150° C for 20 minutes before packaging and, sunflower oil. The following treatments were prepared: Roasted sunflower packed in polyethylene bag (GTC), Roasted sunflower packed in HM bag (GTHM), Roasted sunflower packed in high barrier bag (GTAB), Sunflower oil packed in polyethylene bag (GC), Sunflower oil packed in HM bag (GHM) and Sunflower oil packed in high barrier bag (GAB). The products were stored for 30 (sunflower seeds) and 67 (sunflower oil) days at 25 °C. Peroxide value (PI) and diene conjugate (DC) were evaluated. IP and DC were increased for all treatments during storage days. There were significant differences (α = 0.05) between treatments during storage. At the end of storage, GTC and GC presented the highest values of IP (25.45 and 39.18 mEqO2 Kg-1, respectively), GTAB and GAB had the lowest index (2.25 and 5.49 mEqO2 Kg-1, respectively). GTHM and GHM (20.00 and 9.24 mEqO2 Kg-1, respectively) had intermediate PI. Similar behavior was observed between DC and IP. Packaging made from peanut meal-based films (HMD) improves the chemical stability of roasted sunflower oil and sunflower seeds and extends their shelf life during storage. Taking up again an experience carried out in the 2011/2012 campaign by Agronomist Dionisi from the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of the U.N.C., work was done on buckwheat in dry conditions in the centre of Córdoba, with the aim of starting a series of experiences to learn about the phenological and productive development of the crop in our environment. To this end, during the 2018/2019 season, the Mancan variety was evaluated, the only one registered with the National Seed Institute (INASE). In three sowing dates (FS) the average cycle was 73 days, with a vegetative stage of about 3 weeks, with a flowering that lasted between 3 and 4 weeks, and then there was the formation and filling of the grains, which lasted about 4 weeks. At production level, an average yield of 1.20 g plant-1 was obtained, highlighting the extreme FS (both November and February) as those of higher yield, the average number of grains (NG) obtained was 30 grains plant-1, and the weight of a thousand grains (PMG) of 39.98 g. The general results recorded, speak of a good productive behavior of buckwheat, in an environment representative of the central region of Cordoba. The production of Eucalyptus sp. has climatic limitations due to low temperatures, varying frost resistance with different species and even among different clonal materials. A trial was carried out in the Center-South of Buenos Aires province where Eucalyptus sp. clonal materials were exposed to extreme cold in the field and their behavior was described. During the first winter a minimum of -8.4 °C (50 cm from the ground) was recorded, which meant severe damage to most of the materials. It was concluded that, of the clones tested, DDX00078 (Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus camaldulensis) stood out from the rest, being recommended for use in marginal areas with less severe thermal regimes than the site tested. Remote sensing allows us to record the energy reflected by crops, to study their spatial and temporal variability. The objective of the work was to determine relationships between cultural management characteristics of olive plantations (Olea Europaea L.) and data derived from remote sensing. Eight lots located in La Rioja were surveyed during the period 2016-2018. Age, conduction system and irrigation were recorded. From 72 Landsat 8 images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was obtained for each lot, a time series (2013-2019) was constructed and descriptive statistics of the index were calculated. The results allowed us to differentiate young growing plantations from adult plantations at the zenith of production. The temporal frequency of data collection made it possible to discriminate lots by age, type of irrigation system, and to identify times when specific tasks such as harvesting, suspension in the water supply and rainfall anomalies were carried out.\n",
      "17 The concepts, students gained at school level assist in considering advance form of these conceptions at higher education level. Pakistan being a developing country suffering from low quality at school levels. There are many factors responsible for this condition. Teachers’ proficiency, basic facilities and curriculum are the basic elements of quality education. In Pakistan all these elements are criticized on different forums. Though Pakistan Government is struggling to get rid of these problems to ensure quality in educational system. To meet this objective, and to exploit internal and external resources?different initiatives are taken by government of Pakistan. Currently, Quality education is dire demand of the day. Advancement is contingent to educational quality. Only means of the existence in globalization is quality education. Yet quality cannot be shown to someone as concrete object. It can only be achieved by providing proper facilities, well trained teachers and comprehensive learning materials. In the dearth of one of these facilities, quality education is not possible. That is why, Pakistan Government is ensuring for the provision of quality standards. For this purpose government is consuming not only all internal (local) and external (international) means and human resources also. But some problems slow down this development process and these are hurdles in this way. To remove these barriers Government of Pakistan has fixed some priorities i.e. enhancement of budget to facilitate the schools, revision of curriculum, teachers professional development and allocation of more funds for the development of needy students. In spite of these efforts many more are to be required yet. Some considerable steps are:- (i) Professional elaboration of organizers, principals and other staff members(ii) Formation of Evaluation Committee through associating incentives and grants(iii) District wise planning and application of plans(iv) increase in salaries on teachers(v) provision of science and computer labs. The COVID-19 pandemic has featured the delicacy of the around the world entwined supply chains. Our essential inspiration is to direct a huge scope study utilizing mined information related with multi-level and multi-layer investigation of the worldwide store network of the clinical hardware. We analyse the information structure utilizing network science investigation instruments. This work might be a harbinger for future exploration zeroed in on select levels and layers of arranged production network information. The flow research uncovers a few beforehand obscure examples of the worldwide inventory network including the part of expense safe house countries, Personal Computer programming/equipment industry, semiconductor industry, and engine vehicle and auto bodies in the clinical gear industry. Also, we directed a profound organization investigation of the impact and job of China in worldwide clinical gear. Generally, the outcomes uncover some new and significant bits of knowledge into the worldwide store network as it identifies with clinical hardware. What determines the success and effectiveness of leadership in schools? In the process of managing administrative and educational activities, the leadership effectiveness of school leaders is greatly influenced by a combined set of factors, possibly from leadership competencies and styles as well as local and global socio-economic landscape, latest advancements of science and technology, school culture, and change in modern leadership and management practices, etc. Based on extant literature review of rigorous studies on school leadership as the main methodology adoption, the present paper purposefully seeks to propose a theoretical model of school leadership effectiveness through investigating a network of relationships amongst leadership competencies, leadership styles, external and internal factors, and leadership effectiveness for global K-12 schools. Ultimately, the proposed model has both theoretical and managerial implications. Accordingly, an insight into the nature of these relationships will first expand the existing literature in school leadership and then activate school leader self-efficacy to enrich themselves with standout knowledge, skills, and qualities in the industry and simultaneously tailor their leadership styles to specific educational practices towards change and innovation to optimize leadership effectiveness. The study analyse teacher professional development (PD) in Tanzania in view of school management practice in supporting teacher professional development. The present study take school management practice as a factor which can affect teacher professional development. The instruments which are used for the purpose of data collection were interviews, questionnaires, focus group and documentary review. The study examined the prevalence of teacher’s initiated management practices such as planning &amp; scheduling, short term training programs &amp; seminars, formal mentoring program, meeting held at school level and to encourage teachers on the effective utilization of teachers learning resource. As well the study outcomes recommend the government to increase autonomy to school management to enhance the power to choose specific objective to teacher’s professional development. The socioeconomic development of a country depends upon a sound education system. The current era of technology increases its demand to survive in this globalized world. However, several drastic measures have been taken by Pakistan’s government but are still unable to acquire the goals and struggle with low literacy. On this account, a critical analysis was done to understand the root causes of bad governance of education and propose suggestions to resolve those challenges. The study specified several challenges such as unequal access to education, insufficient resources, unavailability of trained teachers, scared accountability and examination system, socioeconomic gap and private supplementary education. In accordance with the findings, the study also proposed useful suggestions for policymakers and educationists. Over the centuries, China still respectfully treasures rich Asian cultures, traditions, and customs. China is now famous all over the world for its mysterious wonders and cultural &amp; natural heritages such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Terracotta Army, etc. The Chinese history is full with the exposition of outstanding features of Chinese culture such as great thoughts of Confucius, religious beliefs, traditional festivals and customs e.g., Chinese new year, language and calligraphy e.g., Shu Fa, four great inventions of ancient China e.g., papermaking, printing, gunpowder and the compass, traditional architecture and sculpture, traditional art forms, etc. The era of history of China before the time in power of Qin dynasty is known by name as the period of Warring States. This period started from 475 BC and ends at 221 BC. Seven Warring States were included in it i.e. Qin, Wei, Han, Yan, Chu, Zhao, and Qi. Zheng was the King of Qin, who started his journey to triumph over 6 states in the period of 230 BC. Qin was the 1st emperor of this unified state of China. Thus he was known by the name of “First Emperor of Qin” or “Qin Shi Huang”. This study provides a deep insight of Chinese history and it is illustrated that major achievements in Chinese culture and history are contributed in the era of Qin dynasty. This study aimed to investigate the English reading texts in Team-Up in English 1-3 and Grade 9 National Exams or English Ordinary National Educational Test (O-NET) examinations (2014-2017) in terms of reading text types and also take a look at tenses and aspects in the reading texts. Reading texts were collected and analyzed quantitatively by frequency count and qualitatively based on the categories of NSW (New South Wales) Government Education (2011). Twelve tenses and aspects were used to analyze tenses and aspects of the reading passages. Result revealed that the most frequently found text type in both the textbooks and the O-NET examinations was Information Report. Most tenses and aspects found were present simple, and past simple. The present paper attempts to gain insights into Confucius\\' thought of education and to draw lessons for today’s education in the Industry 4.0 era. Confucius, the founder of Confucianism, deserves the world recognition as ‘the great exemplary teacher for generations’ for his dedication and contributions to education with respect to the role, aim, contents, and pedagogical methods of education. As per Confucius, education should be a universal right and not a privilege only to a group of people in society. The theory of ‘no class distinction in education’ soon initiates a real revolution in ancient educational thought, availing education to the broad masses of ordinary people. This radical thought is the greatest of all, attesting the importance of equity and equality in education to people from all walks of life. A synthesis of Confucius\\' thought of education from prior studies, thus, extends the existing literature on education philosophy and expands global understanding of the greatest educational thoughts of all time. These insights have practical implications for today’s educational leaders and policymakers alike. Economic efficiency in production of commodities depends mainly on technological development, geographically location, capital, availability of natural resources, social setup, skilled labours, customs, some economic and financial priorities. Pakistan mostly traded with China, United Arab Emirates, United State of America and Saudi Arabia. The current study is aimed to estimate the impact of different factors affecting the bilateral trade of Pakistan with United Arab Emirates. The study used annual time series data for the period from 1988 to 2019. In this analysis total bilateral trade is used as dependent variable while population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflations and exchange rate of Pakistan and United Arab Emirates (UAE) were used as independent variables. ARDL approach was applied to check the relationship among the variables. The study finds short run and long run significant relationship among the variables. The gaps in business related plans &amp; polices and entrepreneurship deficiency have prevented the country to cope with the technology advancements. Further this gap is also responsible for greater export diversification and putting of Pakistan to accomplish higher value addition. Incompetent and disorganized firms are trying to get tax exemptions and dispensation through lobbying, whereas new emerging efficient and dynamic firms are also not given confidence to take a part in market. The current study is intended to inspect the potential impact of ethical leadership practices (EL) of intermediate level administration (i.e., faculty deans, department heads) on lecturer job satisfaction (LJS) at a private higher education (HE) institution (UX) in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. A conceptual framework linking EL and LJS was developed grounded on the ethical leadership conceptualizations of Brown et al. (2005), Kalshoven et al. (2011), and Langlois et al. (2014). Accordingly, ethical leadership works as a multidimensional construct encompassing a set of five values or explicit behaviors, i.e., care, critique, integrity, fairness, and ethical guidance. Further, the constructs and effects of EL on LJS are primarily conceptualized in light of Social Exchange Theory and Social Learning Theory. Primary quantitative data was collected through an anonymously self-administered survey of all 378 lecturers permanently employed at eight faculties at UX’s main campus via a non-probability purposive sampling method. The totality of 256 valid questionnaires yielded a response rate of 68% for stepwise data analysis with inferential statistical methods (i.e., internal reliability test, factor scores, correlation, and multiple regression). The regression findings reveal that all five dimensions of EL significantly positively explained the variance in job satisfaction as perceived by UX lecturers (p &lt; .001). These findings suggest both theoretical and practical implications. The present study expands our understanding on ethical leadership by verifying its predictive power on the job satisfaction levels as self-reported by HE lecturers. Therein lies a conclusion that well-established ethical conducts for HE administration may assist them in making key decisions with care, fairness, critique, integrity, and ethical guidance. The fact is that teaching and learning vocabulary is one of the most complicated problems, and the traditional way of vocabulary instructions proves ineffective, and even worse, decreasing students’ interest and motivations in their study and work. An experimental case study was conducted with two respective classes at Bac Lieu University, Vietnam. Accordingly, in one experimental class, vocabulary was taught with the cooperative vocabulary games at the practice and revision stages. The results revealed that games could be used to improve non-English-majored students’ learning vocabulary at Bac Lieu University because of its following major effects. Firstly, games brought in relaxation and fun for students, thus helped them learn and retain new words more easily. In other words, students could be more interested in learning the vocabulary. Secondly, games usually involved friendly competition and they kept learners interested. These created the motivation for learners of\n",
      "18 Jaundice persisting beyond 14 days of life is a commonly encountered problem in the neonatal follow-up clinic. Although by far the most common underlying etiology is breast milk jaundice, clinician should not miss out an important surgical condition the extrahepatic biliary atresia (an incidence of about 1 in 10000 live births) whose outcome without a surgical intervention before 8 weeks is dismal. Eminently treatable entities such as hypothyroidism and urinary tract infection also can present as prolonged jaundice. This article will synthesize the available literature on this topic and present an algorithm for evaluation of neonates presenting with prolonged jaundice useful to pediatricians in outpatient practice. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the effect of internet use on the psychosomatic health of adolescent school children in Rourkela. Methods: The study involved a population of 484 school students of Rourkela in the age groups of 13-18 years. History taking and clinical examination were done to know any existing health problem. Young people’s internet usage questionnaire” was handed over to enquire internet use practices. The parents of these children were asked to fill in “pediatric symptom checklist” to know psychological problems. Each answered questionnaire was given a specific serial number. The data collected from these matched sets of questionnaires as per serial number were analyzed using Chi-square test and ANOVA (to compare average number of health problems among the groups). A p&lt;0.05 is considered significant. Results: It was found that more frequent internet user suffered from sleeplessness (p=0.048), increased interest in sexual activity (p&lt;0.001), and conduct problems (p=0.013). Getting cyberbullied had statistically significant association with increased interest in sex (p=0.012), low mood (p=0.001), lack of concentration (p&lt;0.001), anxiety (p=0.002), aggression (p=0.003), backache (p=0.001), headache (p=0.001), eye pain (p&lt;0.001), and attention problems (p=0.017). Visiting porn sites were associated with interest in sex (p&lt;0.001), low mood (p&lt;0.001), lack of concentration (p=0.020), and unexplained anxiety (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Frequency of internet use, cyberbullying, and visiting pornographic sites had a significant association with some physical and psychological health problems. For the victims of cyberbullying, average number inexplicable diseases/problems are significantly more than that of nonvictims (p&lt;0.001). Background: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations due to deficiency of insulin&nbsp;which results in hyperglycemia, ketonemia with ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis. Administration of insulin inhibits the production&nbsp;of keto acids and facilitates their metabolism, thereby helps in correcting the acidosis. However, in some situations, the acidosis&nbsp;takes longer to get corrected. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the factors at admission predicting the duration&nbsp;of acidosis in a child presenting with DKA. Methods: Study Type: This was a retrospective case record review. Inclusion&nbsp;Criterion: All children &lt;15 years who were admitted under the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital from&nbsp;April 2012 to January 2016 with DKA were included in this study. Their demographic data, investigations, treatment details, and&nbsp;length of hospital stay were noted in a predesigned pro forma. Prolonged acidosis was defined as acidosis taking longer than 24 h&nbsp;to resolve. Results: Forty-eight cases met the inclusion criteria; of the 48 cases, 27 (56%) had prolonged acidosis. The median&nbsp;duration of correction of acidosis was 31 h (interquartile range 18.75-48 h/range of 6-192 h). On univariate analysis, children with&nbsp;prolonged acidosis had a low pH (7.1 vs. 7.25), a low serum bicarbonate (4.69 vs. 7.49 mEq/L), base excess (?22.7 vs ?17.04), a&nbsp;high total leukocyte count (TLC) (24,275 vs. 13,557 cells/mm3), and platelet count (450,651 vs. 316,140 cells/mm3) at admission&nbsp;(t-test, p&lt;0.05). On stepwise logistic regression analysis, only low pH and a high TLC were associated with prolonged acidosis.The presence of rhabdomyolysis and myocardial impairment and degree of dehydration at admission which could contribute to&nbsp;prolonged acidosis were not measured in this study. Conclusion: Prolonged acidosis (lasting more than 24 h) was associated with&nbsp;a high TLC and a low pH at admission. Objectives: The aim of this study is to observe the clinical spectrum of presentation of Fanconi anemia (FA) in children presenting&nbsp;to the Hematology Department of Victoria Hospital, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute. Materials and Methods:&nbsp;This observational study was carried out from February 2010 to December 2016 on all the 16 consecutive children &lt;18 years of&nbsp;age, with FA. Those with high frequency of chromosomal breakage in G-banded metaphases from mitomycin-treated cultures were&nbsp;considered as positive cases. Results: The mean age at presentation was 6.79±1.34 years, but for those with dysmorphic featureson examination, it was 4.77±0.98 years. Symptoms of anemia were seen in 14 (87.5%) and of bleeding in 8 (50%) cases. There&nbsp;was a history of prolonged fever at presentation in 5 (31.2%) cases. Dysmorphic features on examination were seen in 10 (62.5%)&nbsp;cases. Short stature and microcephaly and microphthalmia were the most common features. Pancytopenia was seen in 68.7% of the&nbsp;subjects at presentation and anemia in 87.5% of cases while thrombocytopenia was universal (100%). The mean hemoglobin was&nbsp;5.33±0.36 g/dL, mean white blood cell count was 3429.37±477.65/mm3, and mean platelet count was 28156.25±4199.44/mm3. The&nbsp;bone marrow was hypoplastic in 14 (87.5%). Pelvic kidney seen in 5 (31%) was the most common ultrasound finding. Parentalconsanguinity was seen in 50% of cases. Conclusion: Parental consanguinity was common, and there was a male preponderance&nbsp;in our study. The most common presenting manifestations were anemia followed by bleeding. Two-third of the patients had&nbsp;pancytopenia at diagnosis while thrombocytopenia was universal (100%). In the presence of a family history and/or dysmorphic&nbsp;features, even mono- or bi-cytopenias should be evaluated for inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.&nbsp; Background: Probiotics have been used for long in the treatment of acute diarrhea although their efficacy has always&nbsp;remains the subject of discussion. Objective: To determine the effect of probiotics in acute diarrhea among the children in&nbsp;rural population. Method: Double-blinded randomized control trial. We included children of age group 6 months - 5 years&nbsp;suffering from acute diarrhea of &lt;48 h and fulfilling the inclusion criteria. All children were given oral rehydration salts&nbsp;(ORS) ad-lib till the resolution of diarrhea and zinc 20 mg/day for 14 days while intervention arm (n=101) were given&nbsp;probiotic sachet twice a day for 7 days containing Streptococcus faecalis 30 million, Clostridium butyricum 2 million,&nbsp;Bacillus mesentericus 1 million, Lactobacillus sporogenes 50 million, control group were given identical placebo apart from&nbsp;ORS and zinc. Duration of diarrhea in both the groups was measured as primary outcome while secondary outcome was&nbsp;to know the days of maximum recovery from diarrhea in both groups. Results: Totally, 207 patients were randomized to&nbsp;control and study group, out of which, 195 completed the study. Out of total 195 patients, 94 (48.2%) patients were treatedwith standard treatment of diarrhea without probiotics while 101 (51.8%) patients were given probiotics apart from standard&nbsp;treatment of diarrhea. The mean duration of diarrhea was found to be reduced in the study group (4.6 days [2.84-4.776 days])&nbsp;as compared to control group (5.31 days [5.108-5.512 days]), p&lt;0.001. Conclusion: Probiotics significantly reduced the&nbsp;duration of acute diarrhea in children. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to study the relation of total body adiposity and abdominal adiposity markers with&nbsp;forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in adolescents in Bengaluru. Methods: 125&nbsp;healthy children from a school and 70 asthmatics from Ramaiah hospital between 10 and 15 years were included in the study.&nbsp;Anthropometry including weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, and abdominal height was done in all study&nbsp;adolescents. The subjects were categorized according to BMI. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were done by Knudson methodand FEV1, FVC, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured. The patients were classified by their asthma severity according&nbsp;to GINA guidelines. Results: BMI, weight, waist and hip circumference correlated with abdominal height in male asthmatics and&nbsp;controls where they revealed significant correlations with FEV1/FVC% ratio. In females, abdominal height correlated with BMI,&nbsp;weight, waist and hip circumference in both the groups. PEF correlated with BMI, weight, waist circumference, and abdominal&nbsp;height in healthy females. FEV1/FVC correlated with BMI, abdominal height in female asthmatics, with weight in healthy females.Independent predictors of FEV1/FVC% ratio were hip circumference in males and abdominal height, and waist circumference in&nbsp;females. Conclusion: Increase in obesity is associated with reduced lung volumes and flows. The abdominal adiposity markers&nbsp;(waist and hip circumference, and abdominal height) are significant and effective predictors of obesity and the variations of PFT’s&nbsp;than total adiposity markers (BMI and weight). Objective: To find out the effectiveness of an intensive lifestyle modification program in reducing the weight of obese children&nbsp;aged 12-18 years. Material and Methods: Quasi-experimental single group pre-test/post-test study was conducted for 1 year&nbsp;in the outpatient unit of a tertiary care hospital. Obese children aged 12-18 years who gave consent to participate in the study&nbsp;were included as the study subjects. Obesity was diagnosed based on revised Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) 2015 reference&nbsp;percentiles that have been proposed for Asian Indian children with a body mass index (BMI) &gt;27 kg/m2 adult equivalent cut-off&nbsp;taken as obesity. Intervention done was lifestyle modification including diet and moderate aerobic exercises under supervision thrice&nbsp;a week, 1 h each day. Results: A total of 72 children were initially enrolled, and final analysis was performed on 58 children. After&nbsp;completing the 6 months program, the mean BMI reduced from 29.31±4.83 kg/m2 to 27.27±4.46 kg/m2. The mean weight of the&nbsp;study participants decreased to 70.82±16.43 kg from 76.1±17.98 kg, both of which were statistically significant. Conclusion: Study&nbsp;shows the effectiveness of an intensive lifestyle modification program of diet and exercise in reducing the weight of obese children. Background: Children with malnutrition usually exhibit several alterations in the body composition, one of them being a loss&nbsp;of cardiac muscle and its consequences. Aim: The aim of this study is to detect the incidence of cardiac involvement among&nbsp;malnourished schoolchildren as shown by clinical examination and corresponding investigations. Methodology: This is a&nbsp;prospective case-control study conducted on 15 children between 5 and 15 years of age with malnutrition. Inclusion criteria were&nbsp;children who fall under the definition of moderate malnutrition as per the World Health Organization (WHO) Z-score based on&nbsp;the WHO Child Growth Standards. Children with known congenital/acquired heart diseases were excluded from the study. Thesechildren were assessed by echocardiography and estimation of cardiac troponin T (cTn T) levels for cardiac involvement that was&nbsp;compared with 12 healthy controls. Results: The mean left ventricular mass (LVM) was 16.74 units higher in children with normal&nbsp;nutritional status compared with malnourished children (p=0.092, 95% confidence interval=2.91-36.40).The mean LVM index was&nbsp;4.76 units higher in children with normal nutritional status compared with kids with malnutrition indicating the reduction of cardiac&nbsp;muscle mass. Conclusion: As cardiac muscle mass is reduced in children with malnutrition leading to various complications, they&nbsp;need early detection, monitoring, and appropriate management. Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a clinical diagnosis, with common confusion among other causes of febrile illnesses.&nbsp;There are no confirmatory laboratory parameters for diagnosing KD. Objective: To investigate whether low mean platelet volume&nbsp;(MPV) is associated more with fever due to KD than due to the other common causes. Methods: This retrospective case-control&nbsp;study was done on febrile children between 6 months and 6 years of age admitted from January 2015 to January 2017. The MPV&nbsp;values of 28 KD and 50 non-KD febrile children admitted to our hospital were obtained from the hospital records. The diagnosis&nbsp;of KD was accepted only when (1) two pediatricians had agreed upon the diagnosis independently based on the American Heart&nbsp;Association guidelines 2004, (2) no other cause of fever coexisted with KD in a particular patient, and (3) prompt clinical response&nbsp;within 48 h of administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. Using suitable statistical software, the range of MPV in KD fever and&nbsp;non-KD fevers was compared. Results: MPV was lower in the KD group (9.75±0.98 femtoliter) than in the non-KD fever group&nbsp;(11.14±1.53 femtoliter). From the receiver operating characteristic curve, it was found that at MPV ?10.0 fl, KD can be diagnosed&nbsp;with 75% sensitivity and 80% specificity. This means that lower the value of MPV, lower is the probability that a non-KD patientwill be wrongly diagnosed as KD. Conclusion: Our study shows that low MPV is associated with KD. Hence, a low MPV can raise&nbsp;the index of suspicion for KD in febrile children, especially in cases of incomplete KD. Further, prospective studies involving larger&nbsp;sample size are needed to ascertain its diagnostic\n",
      "19 Centenary Preparations at the University of Debrecen. The editors of the journal offer status reports on the preparations for the centenary celebrations of the University of Debrecen in 2010. Special attention is devoted to those publications which thematize the history of the university (as well as the history of its predecessor institutions) and of the faculties, of which pre-eminent position is occupied by the commemorative centenary volume offering a comprehensive history of the university in answer to the expectations and requirements of the 21st century. Brief surveys are provided of preparatory projects such as the ones aimed at establishing a Museum of the University, the processes of conducting interviews pertaining to the history of the university, as well as the emerging programs of the centenary year. Nándor Bernolák (1880–1951), the Second Rector of the Hungarian Royal University of Arts and Sciences in Debrecen. As second rector of the Hungarian Royal University of Arts and Sciences, Debrecen, which was launched in 1914, Nándor Bernolák played an important role in shaping the events of the first years. He was a nationally recognized theoretical criminal jurist when he was invited to chair the department of penal law in Debrecen. In addition to an outline of his brief, seven-year, university career, a discussion of his previous professional activities is offered, and the events of his life pertaining both to the early history of the university and to his subsequent political and legal career are highlighted. Professor Bernolák’s reformist initiatives pertaining to criminal law as well as his attempts aimed at the renewal of law training are likewise reviewed. In summary it is stated that Nándor Bernolák excelled both as a criminal jurist and as a university manager. As regards his political career, it turned out to be rather brief and controversial. In view of the fact that he turned his back to his university commitments, we are obliged to consider him as one of those university professors who was lost for Hungarian higher education when they assumed political commitments. The Impact of the Götti ngen Ideal of Knowledge in the Area of Healing with Reference to Hungary and Transylvania in the 18th Century. This study offers a brief outline of the process through which the medical faculties of the German universities caught up with the leading medical schools of the continent in the 18th century. The paradigm shifts associated with the foundation of the medical faculty at Halle in the first half of the 18th century also manifested themselves in other German medical faculties: at theuniversities of Strasbourg, Göttingen, Vienna, etc. The most important reformist tendencies, as well as the teacher personalities who made it possible for these tendencies to be realized, are also discussed. It is primarily the Göttingen reforms of the second half of the 18th century that are given a comprehensive discussion. In the second part of the paper the studies and professional activities—including their respective scientific work—of about two dozen medical students from Hungary and Transylvania are given well substantiated treatment. The Text and Ministerial Preamble of Article XXXIV of 1912 ”About the Foundation of Hungarian Royal Universities in Debreczen and Pozsony”. The objective of this source publication is nothing else but the bill and its preamble, through which in 1912 the universities of Debrecen and of Pozsony, respectively, came to be established. The preamble signed by Minister of Religion and Public Education János Zichy well reflects all the aspirations and controversies which characterized Hungarian educational and higher educational policy at the end of the 19th century, and the path, punctuated by manifestations of zeal and regression, finally led to the foundation of the third and fourth university in Hungary. The thorough preliminary professionalism pervading the preamble which, despite the disunity of the political spectrum, made a success of the bill can be regarded as exemplary.

The festive speech, of which a footnoted-extended version can be read here, attempted to highlight how the previous five generations of the students of higher education in Debrecen had participated in the celebration of the bourgeois revolution of 1848. It was also important to underscore in this speech that for about a hundred years the student body of the College, then of the University, of Debrecen celebrated together with, indeed at the forefront of, the population of the city while for the past few decades the rituals of the local celebrations have diverged. Budapest’s Eötvös University is 375 years old—Report on ELTE ’s Anniversary Celebration. In 2010 Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary’s oldest continuously operating institute of higher education, celebrated the 375th anniversary of its foundation. The university’s legal predecessor was established in Nagyszombat in 1635 by Péter Pázmány, Archbishop of Esztergom. The text describes the major stages of the preparation for the year of jubilee and the most significant events of the festive year. The chief purpose of the series of events, it is stated, was to strengthen the sense of belonging in the former and current civil community of the university. In addition, the series of festivities offering a multitude of year-long professional and cultural programmes reminded all of the fact that the university, owing to the programmatically high standards it is committed to represent, is an outstanding shaper of scientific and scholarly activity and of training new generations of intellectuals. The Life and Work of Nándor Láng, the First Philologist Rector. Nándor Láng, who came from a German family, in the service of the shared goals of a multicultural Hungary prioritized those ideals which asserted the education of an increasing number of&nbsp; sophisticated scholars and scientists as well as elevating domestic science and scholarship to an international level. In the first period of his career, as a secondary-school teacher, he focussed on supporting the promulgation and teaching of classical culturethrough his scholarly activity, including the authoring of textbooks. A crucial turning-point in his life occurred when he was invited in 1914 to serve as head of one (Latin) of the departments of Classical Philology of the newly created University of Debrecen. In the academic year of 1916/1917 he was Rector of the university, a service that he fulfilled with a maximum commitment and a truly professional approach. The combination of his professional erudition and human characteristics made him an ideal pedagogue.He was active in Debrecen until 1932, when he retired, but he continued to carry on significant sholarly activity in the archeology and epigraphy of the Roman period in Pannonia. British and American Participation at the Debrecen International Summer School before World War Two. This survey focuses on a selected aspect of the history of a peculiar and in many respects unique initiative: the pre-World War One British and American ties of the Debrecen International Summer School, which was established in 1927. In doing so, the study firstly identifies by name those British and American guests who can be documented as having attended the Summer School as officially enrolled students;secondly, it follows up and evaluates those aspects of the teaching program which had a British or American relevance; and, in the third place, it supplies examples for how the International Summer School advertised itself in the English-speaking countries. The survey is concluded by an analysis of selected contemporaneous views formulated by the representatives of the university and of the Summer School with reference to the past and (then) presence of British/American and Hungarian ties. The Loan Transaction of Peregrine Students in Erlangen. The sources—four brief documents—made public here offer an insight into student life at the end of the 18th century: the high fees of tuition, especially the cost of their studies abroad, significantly impacted not only on the cost of education but on the subsequent lives of the students as well. The ”peregrine students” were obliged to take loans, the burdens of which they had to carry for long years. Two of the documents here presented pertain to two peregrinators who completed their studies at the College of Debrecen but had earlier concluded a loan agreement in Erlangen, Germany. In the Archives of the Debrecen Protestant College we can read the texts of the original contracts, as well as the written documents submitted to the home church authorities in the matter of the reclamation of the loaned sum.

      "20 The Qur’anic tāghūt is one of the most often misused religious concept for supporting radicalism. Under the rules of Isutzu’s scholarship, this research wants to approach the Qur’anic tāghūt semantically. It concludes that the basic meaning for tāghūt in the Qur’an is “transgressing bounds” whereas its relational meanings are: idols (in Q. 4: 61, 40: 17, 16: 36), propagandists of digression (Q. 2: 256, 257), false legislation attributed not to God and His Messenger (Q. 4: 60), polytheism (Q. 4: 76) and rebellion to God (Q. 5: 60).\\nKey Word: thāghūt, semantic, relational meanings, Izutsu This study sought to analyze the use of the word libās in the Qur\\'an. Besides plays as concepts related to everyday life, the concept of clothing in the word libās yet fully revealed. Many thought that libās in the Qur\\'an only have meaning as clothing. In fact, the word libās in the Qur\\'an includes of several meanings. Besides, the word libās be an interesting keyword to be studied in linguistic studies, especially using semantic analysis, hope, it can appearing the dynamic messages from The Koran vocabularies which is containing inside by examining analytically toward the concepts which seems to play an important role in the formation of Qur\\'anic vision. This paper concludes that the basic meaning of libās is wearing, and satara (covering). While the relational meaning that once covered later developed into an object that is used to cover (clothes). While the significance of libās from pre and post Qur`anic are same, that is covering. But in its development, The Koran refers to a new meaning as jewelry that used to adorn self (illegitimate). Comprehensively, the concept of libās from the meaning development from pre-Islam to the birth of Islam is drafted by covering something that must be covered. Indicatively, this things becomes characterizes the uniqueness of the Koran, as well as when The Koran adopts a vocabulary from pre-Islamic period which does not immediately change the meaning inside.\\nKey Words: Libās verses, Semantics, Interpretation This research is an answer to the notion that the Koran is not systematic and confused book, that has no cohesion in its topics and themes. This research is seeking for the function of repetition as a device of cohesion in the text of the Koran, particularly in surah al-Baqarah. This research is a library research with data sources from the Koran as a text by using a sample surah al-Baqarah (number 2) as it is written in Mushhaf in circulation today. This study departs from the theory of Halliday and Hasan (1976) of Systemic Linguistics by using methods and techniques of qualitative descriptive analysis. This research indicates that the repetition of language units, either repetition of sounds, especially the form of syllables, repetition of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and or even repetition of topics, creats a ties that can be combined by the text of the surah al-Baqarah. Through repetition in the surah al-Baqarah cohesion or coherence is found in the level of verses of surah, cohesion in topics surah, cohesion surah al-Baqarah, and even the cohesion of the Koran as a whole.Keywords: surah al-Baqarah, the Koran, repetition, cohesion Abstract\\nThe study of manuscript is one of the popular topics in the academical world. Especially for exegesis manuscript, it is rarely found in the archipelago. This research is important for preserving the cultural heritage in the form of manuscript. This article examines the codicological aspects of the manuscript. By using codicological discourse analysis, this research concludes that Jalālain Exegesis Manuscript of Kyai Nur Hisyam Mandirejo was written on European paper. He wrote the manuscript into two volumes for studying and learning significance. He finished writing the first volume in 1269 H. and the second volume in 1361 H. The manuscript is still quite clear to read, while the paper has weathered and even there are some papers lost and broken. By using critical discourse analysis, this research reveals that the manuscript consists of various additional information, such as grammatical or naḥwu explanation of certain words, stories related to certain sentences in the exegesis and ma’na gandhul pegon (interlinier text). By comparing the manuscript to Jalālain Exegesis of printed version that corrected by Muḥammad Dhu al-Kifl Zain al-Dīn al-Waṭanī, it was printed by Dār al-Kutub al-Islāmiyyah on January 2011th M. / Muḥarram 1432 H. The researcher reveals that both of them are similar text but have different main text for the guidelines copying process. Some differences found in several sides of study. This research concludes that there are three patterned errors of manuscript writing, like about the writing of لا, ه (ha`) and ى (alif layyinah).\\nKeyword: Jalālain exegesis, manuscript, Kyai Nur Hisyam, philological study. One of the most popular studies discussed in the Qur\\'anic study today is called living Qur\\'an. Although its phenomenological cultural nuances, but it is still included in the study of scriptures. Since living Qur\\'an is basically began from the phenomenon of the Qur\\'an in Every Day Life. This study discusses not focused on study of texts of the Qur\\'an, but in realm of the importance and practical function of the Qur\\'an in Muslim society. There are pesantrens of al-Qur’an which, in fact, make an important contribution in developing and improving Muslims interaction on the Qur’an. Their roles in creating hundreds or even more than thousands Huffāẓ al-Qur’ān have proven their existences in living Qur’an. Many varieties of methods of and processes of the interaction have been done, so that Qur\\'an become into a live \\\"entity\\\" among muslim community generally and especially for students of pesantren. There are three popular pesantrens have been creating Huffāẓ al-Qur’ān, called Pesantren al-Munawwir Krapyak Yogyakarta, Pesantren Tahfiẓ al-Qur’an al-Asy’ariyah Kalibeber Wonosobo, Central Java, and Pesantren An-Nur Ngrukem Bantul. All these three Islamic boarding school have proven their existence are considered very important in creating society to love al-Qur’an. It becomes important to be discussed, because the study now sought to find out how that pesantrens community interact with the Qur’an. So that the fundamental values of the Qur’an can be manifested in every muslim daily activities and then can always brings spiritual charges to thier soul. This article focuses on muḥkamāt and mutashābihāt from the perspective of Muqātil bin Sulaimān. Study on muḥkamāt and mutashābihāt is of importance because the implications which these topics has are not only on the aspects of linguistics, buat also on those of theology and laws. The choice of Muqātil as the case study is based on the fact that he is the first mufassir who succeeded in publishing the exegesis book of complete thirty juz of the Quran. The problem formulation of this article is the position of Muqātil’s idea on muḥkamāt and mutashābihāt in the battle of theological-political discourses in his era. To answer this, the writer makes use of the history of the schools of thought as the tool of analysis. The conclusion gained from this study is that Muqatil himself basically is not consistent in muḥkamāt and mutashābihāt. On one side, he tends to be in safe position, and on the other side is sometimes considered as mujassimah by many scholars. Such inconsistency is normal along with the growing reality surrounding Muqatil himself and his own realm of thought. This research highlights the divergence in writing between the 1974 Menara Kudus Qur’anic printing and the standardized ‘Uthmanic style in sura Yāsīn. Having examined literatures related to the history of the Kudus version including the text itself, this research concludes that the formerdoes not follow the later in three cases: the omitting (ḥadhf) of the alif and the skeleton of the alone hamzahas well as the connected two hamzah at the beginning of a sentence.Keyword: Sura Yāsīn, rasm Quran Kudus 1974, Uthmnic style. The main idea this article explores is that the knowledge on Arabic language plays great role on the scientific Qur’anic exegesis. As sample, AgusPurwanto’sNalar Ayat-Ayat Semestais chosen, merely on his interpretation on the Q. 76: 17. This research also finds Purwanto’s three foundations thatemphasize the miraculous side of the Arabic language which the Qur’an speaks with: (1) the Paradigm of “Sains Islam”; (2) the dependency on the lexical meaning of the keywords; (3) the author’s Contextualizing the meaning to only current context by ignoring its original context. This research also describes how an interpretation which depends on the knowledge of Arabic language looks like.Keywords: Tafsir Ilmī, Bahasa Arab, Metodologi Jāmi’ al-Bayān min Khulāṣah Suwar al-Qur`ān by KH. Muhammad bin Sulaiman (1329 - 1412 H) Solo, Central Java, is one piece of exegesis work among the others in Indonesia which is not well-known by public. This study is aimed at introducing this exegesis work, through some topics raised here, namely the background or history of the writing, the exegesis methods, sources, systematics, and the contribution of Jāmi’ al-Bayān min Khulāṣah Suwar al-Qur`ān in Indonesia. This study is relevant as to bring this work to the surface to be known by the public. This study concludes that Jāmi’ al-Bayān min Khulāṣah Suwar al-Qur`ān is considered unique. The style of exegesis which KH. Muhammad initiated is in the form of concise commentary points as global essence of the verses. Furthermore, what makes this work of exegesis interesting is the sources of exegesis which are always present in the end of every commentary. To KH. Sulaiman, sanad is prioritized in keeping the orthodoxy of the Qur’anic exegesis.Key words: Jami’ al-Bayan min Khulasah Suwar al-Quran, introduction, related topics. In his Koreksi Terjemah Harfiyah al-Qur`an, Muḥammad Ṭālib, the amīr of the Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia, accuses the official Qur’anic translation by the Indonesian Ministry of Religion for containing digression and at the same time- supporting radicalism. This article wants to describe and examine Ṭālib’s argumentations. It finds that Ṭālib’s inappropriate methodology lets him criticize the manuscript over-confidently. First, He has only read it partially and could not catch the whole meaning it provides. Second, ignoring the fact that the exegetes whom he was referring to may provide alternatives for one particular word, Ṭālib has uncarefully treated his sources.Key word: Qur’anic translation, Indonesian Ministry of Religion, Muḥammad Ṭālib, examine validation The debate on whether Islam as a religion should merge with state is intriguing and seems to never end. One of the prominent Muslim thinkers who was concerned with this issue is Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966), the author of Fī Ẓīlāl alQur\\'ān, a tafsir work which dominantly colors several Islamic movements such as the Ikhwanul Muslimin. This article describes Qutb’s thought on the state and its legal sources elaborated in the mentioned book. It also traces the historical roots of his thought.Keywords: Sayyid Quṭb, Islamic State, Ikhwanul Muslimin, tafsir Fī Ẓīlāl al-Qur\\'ān.\n",

The result in this research indicates that the students’ attitude of English Language Education Study Program and English Letters Study Program at Khairun University in classroom obtained Agree 41.76%, and then followed by Disagree 26.13%, Strongly Agree 20.29%, Strongly Disagree 6.96%, and No Attitude 4, 85%. This research recommended for lecturer to encourage students using English in the classroom actively The research explores hesistation Noises Used suggested by McManis, et al (1988). The goals of the of the analysis are to know the hesistation noises used by the speaker and to find out speaker meaning and intention by using those hestitation noises.The research uses a qualitative descriptive method. The data analyzed by using pragmatic approach. The speaker uses hesistation noises : Uh, Umm, Ehm, Uh-uh, and Uh. The speakers use those hesistation noises to show uncertainty and fear, thinking, feeling clumsy and confused, agreement or understanding, and recalling. ABSTRACT: This research aims at revealing and analyzing errors made by the fourth-semester students of English Education Study Program, Khairun University. Dulay, Burt, and Krashen (1982) categorized errors into two types, namely global and local errors. Global errors refer to errors that affect overall sentence organization significantly hinder communication. While, errors that affect single element (constituents) in sentences do not usually hinder communication significantly are called local errors. The scholar focuses on analyzing students’ errors in translating legal terms in English into Indonesian. This research is qualitative research that is analyzed the data descriptively. The research shows that there are many errors occurred in students’ target-language text. The errors made by the students dominantly indicate local errors with the percentage of 81.57% as the errors which do not influence or disturb the readers’ understanding. While, global errors’ percentage is 18.43%. The research explores hesistation Noises Used suggested by McManis, et al (1988). The goals of the of the analysis are to know the hesistation noises used by the speaker and to find out speaker meaning and intention by using those hestitation noises.The research uses a qualitative descriptive method.

This study aims to: (1), Knowing the share of expenditure, the progress of prices of staple food and people\\'s income in Central Halmahera Regency, (2), Analyzing the level of people\\'s purchasing power with an indicator of the ratio of income to prices of staple foods in Central Halmahera Regency, and (3), Analyze the level of people\\'s purchasing power with an indicator of the ratio of income to the index of staple food prices in Central Halmahera Regency. The results of the analysis show that the expenditure of community households in Central Halmahera Regency is specifically allocated to fulfill the consumption of fresh rice and fish, followed by consumption of flour, sugar and cooking oil. While the allocation of expenditures for consumption of staple-sourced staple foods includes chicken, milk, eggs and beef is still very low. The price of staple food in Central Halmahera Regency during the observation period of 2009 until 2018 in January - March, tends to increase in the range of 2% - 12%. Whereas on the other hand, the level of income of the community only changes in the range of 5% - 7%, with the highest income enjoyed by employees and entrepreneurs and conversely the lowest income is felt by farmers. The purchasing power of people in Central Halmahera Regency with an indicator of the ratio of income to each of the staple food prices tends to fluctuate but has experienced significant improvements in 2018 compared to 2009, except for the purchasing power measured as equal to beef consumption. The purchasing power equivalent to beef consumption has decreased to 22.32% because the percentage increase in income is less able to compensate for the increase in beef prices. Measured by the income ratio indicator on the basic food price index, people\\'s purchasing power also showed an improvement in 2018 compared to 2009, but that only happened to farmers, construction workers, and civil servants groups I / II. When compared to 2017, public purchasing power in 2018 as a whole decreased by 12.38%. The purchasing power level of people in Central Halmahera Regency from the lowest ranking in sequence is felt by groups of farmers, followed by construction workers, civil servants groups I / II, entrepreneurs and employees. The aim of this research is to find out the strategies that are used by English students of Batanghari University in translating texts from English to Indonesian language. The method of this research is qualitative. The sample is taken from the third semester students of English Education of Batanghari University which consists of two classes; one class consists of 27 students and anothe one consists of 33 students. The instrument of this research is a translation test. In analying the data, translation theory proposed by Newmark is used. The findings of this research show that there are only four methods used by the students in translating the text. They are word-for-word translation, literal translation, free translation, and communicative translation. Moreover, the most dominant method used by the students are literal translation method. The second dominant method is word-for-word translation. Meanwhile, the third and fourth translation method applied by the students are free translation and communicative translation. From the result of the analysis, it is also shown that there are four methods which did not applied by the students in translating the text. They are faithful translation, semantic translation, adaptation translation, and idiomatic translation method. Here, the students used more than one method to translate the narrative text. Based on the data, literal translation method is the most dominant method used by the students. It happened because the students just translate the words by its literal meaning and they tried to achieve the nearest equivalence meaning in the target language. This research was conducted to see the attitudes of student-employees at the undergraduate level towards the implementation of erotic capital in their workplaces and without a large implementation of this erotic capital is built up in the world of work, especially the recruitment of an employee. The literature review in this study originates from the concept of erotic capital or sexual capital from Hakim (2010), namely: beauty, sexual attractiveness, social skill, liveliness, social presentation, sexuality, and fertility. A descriptive survey research was used for this study with 295 student-employees as respondents who answered the questionnaire proposed by the researcher. Simple percentages are used for data analysis. The findings of the study revealed that of the 7 indicators of erotic capital, only liveliness was addressed by student-employees both cognitive, behavior and affective. Meanwhile, social skills are only addressed in a cognitive manner and sexual attraction is addressed in an affective manner. The rest is treated as something that is not needed in an employee. So erotic capital actually exists and is considered when recruiting an employee at a company in Indonesia.

ABSTRACT. The research is entitled Reference in Narrative Texts. Writer investigates hypothesis focused on reference usage. The reference is as a part of cohesive devices in grammatical cohesion, and narrative is a mode of genre in text. The research is developed in distribution and frequency in cohesive device. The objectives of this research are to analyze and describe (1) entities or piece of informations appear or refer to the same referent; (2) reference as indicator genre; and (3) accurance and distribution of links within a text and a group of texts. In 120 cohesive ties, (1) Non-Possessive Personal Reference occupies the first ranking. The data indicates 56 cohesive ties, (2) Demonstrative Reference occupies the second ranking. The data indicates 45 cohesive ties; and (3) Comparative Reference occupies the last ranking. The data indicate 6 cohesive ties. It means in the narrative text, the Comparative Reference is rarely used. The writer adopted theories of Halliday and Hassan and Wendy Swanson to establish relationship within a text. These are appropriate with the analyzed texts as they have given comprehensive and adequate treatment of the subjects; besides that, He consider other theories like Ann M. Johns, Megan Watkins, Linda Gerot and Peter Wignell, and some others. Further research can involve in different text, such as: expository text, report text, spoof text, explanation text, news item text, analytical and hortatory text, and etc. because genres vary. Keywords : cohesive device; reference items; narrative text Syntex subject is one of the subjects that students of English Education Study Program should take it.

Such is the&nbsp;importance of noble character, so that guidance must continue to be carried out at&nbsp;a minimum along with the modernization of information technology. Noble&nbsp;character according to the term especially in Islam as a believer is&nbsp;defined as the nature or temperament of someone who has been attached and will&nbsp;usually be reflected in the behavior of that person. Someone who has good&nbsp;character will usually have good temperament or character too and vice versa&nbsp;someone who has a bad temper tended to have despicable character.&nbsp;There is no noble character for people who are not believers, so there is no&nbsp;faith for people who are despicable, because only people of noble character are&nbsp;able to avoid despicable deeds. But the reality of life still occurs behavior that is&nbsp;contrary to noble morals, such as those who relieve performing prayer, perform&nbsp;other acts of corruption: corruption, extortion, embezzlement, murder and turn&nbsp;am&nbsp;ong students still occur&nbsp;From the description above we observe that there are still many&nbsp;incompatibilities between moral values, with the attitudes and behavior of some&nbsp;people, including students. Therefore, noble moral formation is still needed, and&nbsp;for this purpose management intervention is still very important.&nbsp;The method used is descriptive method, which means understanding what&nbsp;is the object of writing, looking at various situations or social realities that exist in&nbsp;society from various sources that can be trusted, writing on online media is the&nbsp;subject of discussion.&nbsp;The results expected in this paper are to create a generation that is&nbsp;trustworthy, consistent, patient and trustworthy, in entering the era of information&nbsp;technology modernization, and able to avoid the negative influence of information&nbsp;technology. Therefore community development, including students to have noble&nbsp;character, is a necessity, because only in this way can the national education mandate be created, namely creating the potential&nbsp;of students to become human&nbsp;beings who believe and fear the Almighty God, have noble character, are healthy,&nbsp;knowledgeable , capable, creative, independent, and a democratic and responsible&nbsp;citizen. The values of religion in SMANJA recently is described as a school community which hasn’t applied the values of religious (optimally/maximally) in daily life. The school life has not given the life based on the religious values taught by islam. The headmaster is trying to motivate all the school citizen to create/ develop the religious values and try to implement the values at school maximally. In daily life, most of school citizen do implement the religious values at school, for example: a) The activity of praying dzuhur and ashar, b) The activity of prayer Dhuha&nbsp; are not maximally implemented.&nbsp;The goal of this research is to reveal the principal’s leadership of developing the religious values in SMANJA. 1. Describing the religious values which are implemented in school community. 2. Describing the role and the effort of the principal in developing the religious values. 3. Describing the response of school citien in the offense of developing the religious values.&nbsp;This research applies the qualitative research approach. The sources of the research are the school principal, the vice principal, the teachers, the TU staff, OSIS committee and Remush, while the data collecting methodology is done by observation, and documentation. The results of the research are analyzed by data reduction, data display and data verification.&nbsp;The result of the research on the leadership in developing the religious values principal in SMAN Jatiroto including: 1. A calling for praying dhuhurwhichis done by the OSIS committee’s member in turn. 2. Holding the Dhuhur/Ashar praying. 3. Celebrating the Islamic Religion Day. 4. Holding the examination DO’A together with students of XII grade and their parents face the national and school Student moral decline, it takes a serious effort from the school to anticipate various forms of student delinquency in school. One way that can be taken is to build students\\' morals so that they are noble, responsible, strong, and honest personalities, and form strong characters in their lives, especially morals in the form of morality. Efforts to form good morals in students, systematic arrangements are needed, such as teaching management or the learning process. Through the learning process, schools need to pay attention to the development and improvement of mentality in students. Thus, a special management is needed that is developed by the school to improve students\\' moral quality. For this reason, integrated steps are needed from various parties, both schools, teachers, students, student organizations, and the participation of parents. Based on the description above, this study intends to find out how the implementation program of moral education in students in the context of moral education management applied by East Lombok State Madrasah Aliyah (MAN) 1 is a preventive / repressive effort in dealing with the usual forms of student / teenage delinquency in school and also included outside of school because the most important is also in overcoming the delinquency process. This study uses a qualitative approach. The research subjects were principals, teachers, employees, students, parents of students. While the research informants were principals, teachers, school committees, parents, community leaders, students. Data collection techniques using the method of observation, interviews, and documentation. The data validity technique uses an extension of participation, persistence of observation, triangulation (methods and sources). Data analysis techniques using interactive models consist of data collection, data reduction, data presentation and verification. The results showed that 1) Implementation of management of moral education in students of MAN 1 East Lombok: a) carried out through intraculicular, extracurricular and habituation activities. The implementation of management runs in a structured, integrated and normative manner based on Islamic values, as well as by example. b) The principal in MAN 1 East Lombok has carried out management functions namely planning, organizing, coordinating, directing, monitoring and evaluating. The purpose of this study is to\\nknow the role of women in improving family economy in the South\\nSakra Village, Sakra District East Lombok Year. The type of\\nresearch used in this study is research Qualitative descriptive.\\nThe data collection technique used is technique observation,\\ndocumentation, and interviews. The results of the study indicate\\nthat there are several factors within socio-cultural life of the\\npeople of the Sakra Village south of Dasan Tereng Village which\\naffects the women farmers to help in life the family economy,\\nnamely: mutual cooperation and help in the life of the farmer\\'s\\nfamily. and there are four important factors that become\\nencouraging women of South Sakra Village farmers to take part in\\nhelp the family\\'s economic life, including: (1) environmental\\nfactors the availability of supporting facilities in the form of\\nagricultural land and markets that can support in expanding\\nmarketing of agricultural products (2) economic factors, namely:\\nthe decreasing level of income of farmers, in the farming community\\nSouthern sakra village has three forms of the role of female\\nfarmers in life his family, namely: in family income, in financial\\nmanagement and in household settings. (3) family factors, namely:\\nnumber dependents, the more the number of dependents the more you\\nhave to fulfilled. (4) education factor, which does not require\\nhigher education, so this work becomes an alternative. The form of\\nthe role of female farmers in improving the family economy in the\\nSouth Hamlet Sakra Village Dasan Tereng has three things: (1)\\nworking in the agricultural sector, (2) working in the livestock\\nsector, (3) working in the trade sector. Based on the things above\\nwomen farmers in the southern sakra village have a dual role,\\nnamely public role and domestic role to help economic life his\\nfamily. The pattern of educating children\\nor the method of educating children from before birth to school age\\nis a necessity for a mother. Mother is the first and main\\ngeographical teacher in pre-school children\\'s education. The age of\\ntoddlers to pre-school for children is golden age. Learning while\\nplaying is a certainty, playing is the first education for children\\nunder five. The age of a toddler is like a blank cassette that can\\nstore and record something that is accustomed to and experienced in\\nthe development of a child\\'s life. For parents, if they expect\\ntheir children to become children who are good enough to have to\\nhave insight and knowledge of management of pre-school children\\'s\\neducation. Among the many models and patterns of education\\nmanagement, the easiest way to deliver children to become good and\\nnoble children is quran-based management. Al-Qur\\'an is a holy book\\nfrom the most holy God, it will be easily digested and accepted by\\nthe core of the teachings to children who are still pure. In terms\\nof management of the pre-school education based on the Qur\\'an, it\\nis intended for parents to plan for their children to always listen\\nto the chants of the Qur\\'an. Then group them into playing the\\nverses in the form of per juz al-Qur\\'an in one month. Then the\\nparents evaluate the child who has been refreshed by the Qur\\'an, if\\nthe chanting is paused, what will happen to the child\\'s reaction.\\nIf you cry, it means that the spirit of the Qur\\'an has entered your\\nheart and soul. The situation is valid for 30 juz, so the child for\\n30 months has listened to and recorded 30 juz verses of the Qur\\'an,\\nGod willing, the age of pre-school children has been memorized and\\nwill be smart with the waslah verse of the Qur\\'an. This is a\\nQur\\'ani-based management that gives birth to children who love and\\nlove to read the Qur\\'an and the hafidz of the\\nQur\\'an. Facilities and infrastructure are\\none of the aspect which is needed to be concerned in implementing\\nManagement Based School and the foundation is the authority\\nand&nbsp; responsibility of the school. This research is the\\nfield research that was chosen by purposive. The purpose of this\\nresearch is to analyze the results of research relating to\\nplanning, implementing, monitoring the problems and efforts to\\nhandle the problems in implementing the facilities and\\ninfrastructure at school. In this research, the writer uses\\ndescriptive analysis method that is started with observing,\\ninterviewing, and documenting as the steps of data collection to\\ncollect all sources that related to problems of the research. Then,\\nthe writer verifies the accurancy of the data using the technic of\\ntriangulism. After doing this research, the writer concludes that:\\nManagement based school means the changing in taking adjusments\\nfrom the education center to the school. The planning of\\nimplementation the facilties and infrastructure starts with\\nanalyzing the needs, doing survey, choosing the main need and\\nimplementing educational specification, The implementation of\\ndevelopment facilities and infrastructure is carried out through\\nassistance of schoolâ€™s comitee,\\nstudentsâ€™ parents and government. The\\nsupervision of development facilities and infrastructure is done\\nthrough a directly approach and non directly approach. The hading\\nproblems in implementing facilities and infrastructure is the lack\\nof involvement of businessmen in educational environments, lack of\\nthe skills in schools; managerial comitee, lack of the competency\\nof the studentsâ€™ parents and society, and the\\nlack of involvement of the students in the process of maintaining\\nthe facilities and infrastructure in the school. The efforts that\\nhave been done to handle this problems in implementing facilitites\\nand infrastructure is personal coaching personnel, improving the\\nmanagementâ€™s quality, developing the main\\ncommitment with the students; parents and prospective students, and\\nalso making the relation together with another\\nschool. Education has a important role in\\nthe advancement of human civillization, especially in terms of\\ndeveloping normative values so that education not only creates\\nintelligent human beings but also creates humans who know their\\nresponsibilities as servants of God and soxial beings.

      "24 The publication presents the design features of an important component of the national female Azerbaijani costume - kelagai shawls. A historical analysis of the development of the kelagai production, which reflects the ethnographic, historical, artistic features of folk art, is carried out. The technique. In the research, modern methods of scientific analysis were used: historiographic, literary-analytical, system-structural, and also the methods of classification of ornamental elements. The scientific novelty of the presented research consists in a systematic analysis conducted for the first time of ways to build the structure and ornamental motifs of the national women\\'s kerchiefs, kelagai, as an important symbolic element of the Azerbaijan national costume complex and provides opportunities for understanding the customs and rituals of that time. The results of the study. Developed proposals for the use of scarves - kelagai in the design of modern fashionable women\\'s clothing, as one of the elements of the national Azerbaijani costume, in order to preserve national traditions and their use in modern clothing. The peculiarities of making kelagai scarves are investigated and the factors affecting their structure and structure, as well as their role in shaping the national characteristics of modern fashion, are identified. The structure and structure of kelagai shawls are studied, based on the texture of the fabric structure. The inclusion of the components of national culture and ethno design in the design-education process enables the creation of creative professional design thinking of future designers of clothing. The practical significance of the presented research lies in the possibility of using national traditions of making kelagai shawls in the design of modern clothing as one of the symbolic elements of folk culture and an important component of artistic and compositional patterns of shaping promising models of modern women\\'s clothing, as well as for the dynamic development of material and spiritual culture. The costume reflects ethnographic, historical, artistic features of folk art, which were also manifested in the creation of certain forms of it. Analysis and determination of the most promising and economical plasma technologies for processing polymeric textile materials to obtain materials with specifi ed properties. Methodology. The article uses analytical methods for the study of diff erent types of plasma treatment of polymeric textile materials and their impact on the properties and structure of these materials. Results. Diff erent types of plasma treatment of polymeric textile materials are analyzed. Of the physical methods of modifi cation, the most promising are plasma technologies that can reduce environmental pollution. Thermal plasma has extremely high temperatures and cannot be used to modify and treat the surface of PTM fi bers. The choice of a certain type of cold plasma for the treatment of PTM depen ds on the speed of their processing, the sample size and the degree of the proposed modifi cation. The infl uence of diff erent types of plasma treatment of polymeric textile materials on the change of their structure and properties, as well as the causes and features of such changes are determined. Practical value. The application of plasma technologies in the textile and light industry allows to replace the technological operations of processing polymeric textile materials that require high consumption of water and chemical reagents, for the processes of their dry processing. This reduces the consumption of chemical materials and reduces energy costs. Installation and maintenance of atmospheric pressure equipment is much simpler and cheaper than low pressure plasma equipment Investigation of the possibility of using the existing regulatory and technical documentation for the design of clothing for boys of primary school age. Methodology. The work uses the contact method of obtaining anthropometric information characterizing the fi gure of the child. An anthropometric method was used to determine body types. Findings. The manufacture of clothing according to the existing regulatory and technical documentation does not take into account the modern features of the body of children, which will lead to a violation of the conformity of the fi nished product to a decrease in consumer satisfaction with commensurate clothing. This indicates the need for a broad study of the physique of the child population in order to revise the existing system of typical fi gures, namely, to determine the optimal number of fi gures, typ es of physiques and their quantitative characteristics. A signifi cant discrepancy between the typologica l composition of the fi gures in comparison with OST 17-67-88 and the composition of the typical fi gures of modern boys has been established. Only 48.34% of today\\'s primary school age boys are provided in the industry standard, and 3.7% in other child standard age groups. Originality. Based on the analysis of modern typical fi gures of boys of primary school age, the percentage distribution of standard sizes in the sample was calculated and a list of typical fi gures that were absent in the children\\'s industry standard was established. Practical value. The typological composition of the fi gures of boys of the younger age group has been determined, taking into account the leading dimensional characteristics to ensure an increase in the level of satisfaction of this group of children in the clothing of boys of mass production. The purpose of the work is to develop of a design project of clothing for practicing yoga based on an analysis of the consumption environment. The methodological basis of the work is the principle of systemicity. The tasks assigned led to the use of an integrated approach with the method of system analysis. During the formation of requirements for clothing for yoga, an expert survey method has been used for take into account the views of consumers. The analysis of the products range for yoga in the modern market for goods has been performed, advantages and disadvantages have been identified. It has been established that most types of yoga clothing are general purpose sports clothing, which suitable for different sports, and home clothing. The analysis of the consumption environment has been performed on the basis of a study of human movements during yoga. In order to take into account the views of consumers a questionnaire survey of experts (yoga trainers and practicing yoga people) regarding the range of products, the type of materials, their raw materials, silhouette and colors of clothes and the ranking of consumer requirements for yoga clothing has been conducted. The main approaches and requirements for the design of yoga clothes have been formed on the basis of the questionnaire results. A design project for a yoga suit has been proposed, which consists of a sweater and trousers -\\\"Afghani\\\". The role of color in yoga culture has been analyzed. On the front of sweater the colors spectrum has been reflected symbolically in the order that corresponds to the colors of the person seven chakras, in order to facilitate the isualization of chakras color in the space for beginner yogis during the asanas performance. Increasing the level of comfort of underwear for pilots of military aircraft by improving the design and technology for its manufacturing. Methodology. The research was based on the systems approach, analysis and synthesis of information on various designs of underwear for the service personnel, methods for details and knots processing.

Currently the Order No. 370 “On Approval of Samples of the Military Uniform and General Requirements for Insignia for Service Personnel and Students of Military Lyceums” of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine as of July 18, 2017 approved the samples of the between-seasons underwear and underwear for cold weather (thermal underwear) that consists of a shirt and long johns. Resolution No. 278 “On the Uniform for Policemen” of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine as of April 19, 2017 also approved the description and samples of A- and B-type thermal underwear for policemen that consists of the underwear vest and long johns. The specifi cation s for manufacturing of underwear for the service personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces made of polyester threads with enhanced capillary action ensuring fast vaporous moisture removal but unable to prevent development of the pathogenic microfl ora and unpleasant body smell in the course of physical activity while perfo rmance of the assigned missions have been prepared. The main drawback of design of the abovementioned samples of the underwear from the perspective of its dynamic conformance to the conditions of usage by fl ight offi cers including the pilots of military aircraft is the straight silhouette shape resulting in redundant volume of cuff s and long johns of the garments. Based on the analysis of various types of the service personnel underwear the design was improved and the technology for manufacturing of underwear for pilots of fi ghting vehicles was off ered. The develope d samples of underwear vest and long johns conform to the applicable requirements for dynamic conformance and comfort. The samples of knit fi bres for manufacturing underwear were made in the knitting laboratory of Kyiv N ational University of Technologies and Design. Yarn based upon the fi re resistant meta-aramid fi bres (the oute r layer) and DEOKIL® - fi bre yarn with antibacterial properties and deodorizing eff ect (the inner layer) were u sed as the raw material for formation of the functional layers. Scientifi c novelty. Ensuring dynamic conformance of underwear for the pilots of military aircraft to its usage conditions.Practical value. New design of functional underwear corresponding to its intended use was developed and its fabrication techniques were off ered. The purpose of the work is to improve the design and manufacture of cloth for practicing yoga for take into account of studying the materials properties. Methods.

      "26 The author of this article seeks to situate the hermeneutic tradition and the outlook of Hans-George Gadamer in particular, in the light of certain strategic dilemmas in the human sciences which, in the author\\'s opinion, involve a common question: the status assigned to uniqueness. Recognition of the importance and the persistence of this problem permits the distinction of three particularly significant positions, tributaries of the Enlightenment and of romanticism. Hermeneutics, as it is understood in the essay, represents the neo-romantic position, characterized by the attribution of pertinence to difference in its irreducible aspect. Yet, unlike what is known as the \\\"philosophy of difference\\\", it does not reject Hegelian inspiration in the appropriation of Heidegger\\'s legacy. The author tries to demonstrate that the triangular framework resulting from the viewpoint chosen as the ordering focal point (the question of uniqueness) is productive - though, of course, not the only one possible - because it sheds light on decisive facets to contemporary debates. He points to the privileged role that the hermeneutic tradition could play in the progression of the controversy, which is of necessity defined as incomplete. This essay makes up for a serious deficiency, introducing the Brazilian public to the field of historiographical analysis in Portugal, using the works of three well-known historians: Alexandre Herculano, Oliveira Martins and Antônio Sérgio. Starting with the black years of the Salazar period, when Portuguese historiography was isolated from developments in other European countries, the author brings us up to the present, offering a panorama of current historical production in Portugal. In Brazil, the contributions of at least three renowned historians - Vitorino Magalhães Godinho, Joel Serrão and Oliveira Marques - can no longer be overlooked, not to mention an illustrious group of newer names who produce historical analyses of the utmost importance. This article discusses the special position occupied by José Honório Rodrigues in Brazilian historiography and provides biographical information corelating his professional life and his intellectual production. As director of the Rare Books Division of the National Library, history professor at the Instituto Rio Branco, and director of the National Archives, José Honório came into contact with the problems relative to documentary sources in Brazil and was able to formulate proposals which aimed at reducing, if not soving, problems in this area. His contribution as a publisher of texts and author of reference works, essays on diverse topics, historical research on specific events in Brazilian life and books on theory, methodology and historiography is reflected in the vast body of work which has now begun to be analyzed, a task to which this article makes an important contribution This article focuses on the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute (IHGB) and the historiographical project that it implemented in undertaking the study and writing of the nation\\'s history. Founded in 1838, a time when the model of a centralized national state met with resistance from diverse sectors of Brazilian society, the IHGB was to orient a line for interpreting Brazilian history based on the civilizing and progressive role of the state - first Portuguese and, as of 1822, Brazilian. With its proposal to interpret Brazilian nationality, the Institute was to play a key role in unifying the political and intellectual élites in 19th century Brazil, making a significant contribution to the construction of the myths and the imaginary content of nationality. The Revista do Instituto Histórico, which the Institute published on a regular basis from the time of its foundation, became a distinguished forum for discussions of a political and cultural nature revolving around the question of national organization, its bases and content, during hte 19th century. For this reason, it proved to be an indispensable source for analyzing this cultural institution and the scholarship that it produced about Brazil. This article discusses the modern conception of history in the work of Capistrano de Abreu. Firs, the author presents a brief analysis of the way in which historical studies were conducted during the classical period, establishing a parallel with the modern outlook for a more detailed study of two texts by Capistrano de Abreu: \\\"Brazil\\'s discovery - its development during the 16th century\\\" and \\\"The discovery of Brazil - Settling the land - Social evolution\\\". An examination of the first clarifies the role played by the mechanisms of documentary criticism within current historiographical trends; and a study of the second points to the importance assigned to narrative procedures in the historical writing of our times. These two works contribute to the formulation of a specific notion of truth, factual and objective, which constitutes one of the main tools used by western reason in its secular attempt to neutralize the development of a tragic view of existence. Treating cinema as a historical document raises a number of theoretical-methodological issues since it requires us to questio the nature of the relationshiip between motion picture images and the society that produces these images. In order to analyse this debate, the article examines th evalue that has historically been attached to cinema as a document and systematizes different conceptions and approaches to the topic. It also endeavors to clarify the differences between working with written documents, as most historians do, and working with audio-visual documents, in this case, movies. The treatment of such material demands intellectual reflection that extrapolates the knowledge acquired within a historian\\'s particular professional field, thereby posing certain challenges, outlined in closing. New technologies for producing and administering information as a product of industrial societies have emerged. The article examines the development of the concept of information as from the 1960s. Its evolution fostered a theoretical and practical re-evaluation of archive science and altered both professional and institutional profiles. The text also analyzes the situation of Brazilian archives in the face of new demands in information management and access. During the twentieth century, the field of historical knowledge felt the effects of three theoretical crises that of the classic physical-mathematic paradigm, of philosophical idealism, and of historicism. The discussion shifted from methodology, typical of the nineteenth century, to epistemology. In this context, the epistemology of history, unlike methodology, is filled with potentialities and a constant reviser of the classic questions in historical knowledge, be it throough pure investigation, be it in the \\\"empirical field\\\", that is, historiography. These questions include: objectivity/objectivization; the \\\"nature\\\" of the process and the explanation; concept construction; and the framing of issues. This testimony by the Brazilian anthropologist Viveiros de Castro, a specialist in Amerindian societies, highlights the context of this scholar\\'s academic training at the Museu Nacional in the mid-1970s and his ethnnographic work on two groouups of indigenous peoples, the Yawalapiti of the Alto Xingu and the Arawetè of Ipixuna. The theoretical and institutional landscape of Soouth American etnology is examined, along with its relation to contemporary anthropological theory. By way of conclusion, na ongoing project dealing with kinshhip theory is described. Prof. Koselleck has dedicated himself to the history of concepts (Begriffsgeschichte) for some thirty years. Starting from the premise that this kind of history cannot be detached from social history, in the present text he investigates theoretical problems implicit to this field of research, particularly as regards the relation between language and history. In this overview of the economic problems plaguing Brazil in the 1920s, the central focus is on 1922, a year of grave economic crisis characterized by falling coffee prices, rising inflation, and a serious fiscal crisis. The artical links the international politic moment, the national political picture, and the debates surrounding the policy of stockpiling coffee to hold up prices.\n",

A lot of factors are influenced by the gastrointestinal system, modify it both positive and negative way.&nbsp; They are: nutrition, avian immunological state, breeding, and the environment, items intimately related to the intense genetic selection that was subject to this commercial avian. Nowadays, the words lay force to remove the antibiotic growth promotor for natural additives in avian production.&nbsp; So, the research in avian nutrition is looking for natural additives, which influence over productive performance and gastrointestinal: probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotic, organic acids, enzymes, and phytibiotics, with good prognostic for using in avian nutrition, but some of them are still in study Canine hepatozoonosis is a parasitic disease acquired by ingestion of ticks infected with protozoa of the genus Hepatozoon (H). Hepatozoon canis is the only species found so far in Argentina, and it is a parasite of frequent presentation in the dogs of our environment. In this work, through a retrospective study, the most common clinical characteristics and hematological aspects found in dogs with this parasitosis were surveyed. For this, the medical records of the FAV School Hospital were analyzed, from 2002 to 2014. The most common findings were fiber, pale mucous membranes, adenomegaly and ocular secretion, normochromic macrocytic anemia and leukocytes within the reference values. Approximately 19% of Argentina’s surface is occupied by saline soils. It is known that these soils have a limited biomass production capacity. However, productivity can be recovered and / or significantly improved with technologies designed and applied according to their structural and functional characteristics. This article presents a series of proven technologies for the recovery of biomass production in saline soils. In this sense, first the theoretical aspects that characterize the structure and operation of soils whose rooting profile is in contact with a saline water table are reviewed. Then the principles of use and management are established, both for the design and for the application of nine technologies with an emphasis on the recovery of productive capacity and each of these techniques is briefly described. Finally, a list of plants adapted to these edaphic conditions and that constitute current and potential crops for the production of biomass destined for fodder, biofuel, medicinal use, human consumption and wood is presented. In tuberculosis, the knowledge of the different types of lesions allows to understand the pathology and transmission of the disease. Goats play an important role in transmitting this condition to cattle and humans.\\nThe objective of the present work is to describe the macroscopic and microscopic lesions observed in natural infected goats with&nbsp;Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). Fifty-five tuberculin test positive goats were analyzed, detailing the macroscopic and microscopic pathological presentations. Among them, 5 animals with lung cavity lesions were found. It is concluded that in natural infected goats, a wide variety of lesions is observed, mainly affecting the respiratory system; some of them very directly involved with the transmission of the disease within the herds.\\nARK CAICYT:&nbsp;ark:/s26182734/qszr0u9wn The advance of cities increases impermeable surfaces and generates negative impacts. Green roofs are an alternative way of dealing with this situation. Plants growing upon roofs are subject to extreme environmental conditions, in Rio Cuarto these conditions are amplified because it´s a sub-humid region. In order to be durable, the combination of species that tolerates the bioclimatic factors of the place must be found. Plant life forms represent different patterns of resource use and adaptations to the environment, making the yield and suitability of plants in communities superior to those in isolation. In our area studies are needed to determine performance in microcosms with different combinations of grass species, both native and exotic and creeping herbaceous.

Helicobacter alters the inhibitory control of gastrin release controlled by somatostatin produced by the D cells of the gastric glands and results in an excessive acid secretion causing ulcers. The relationship between Helicobacter spp and functionality of Somatostatin-producing cells in gastric samples of pigs from slaughterhouse (Río Cuarto-Córdoba) with histopathological diagnosis of acute gastritis was studied. Giemsa and Warthin Starry stains were used to determine Helicobacter spp and immunohistochemicals for the detection of Helicobacter spp and D cells using commercial antibodies. The statistical analysis was carried out with InfoStat version 2011. There were no statistically significant differences between acute and chronic gastritis Helicobacter (+). There werestatistically significant differences between chronic gastritis Helicobacter (+), Helicobacter (-) and normal mucosa. These results indicate that Helicobacter spp associated with gastritis do not alter the number of somatostatin producing cells. This work exposes in a practical way a technique for the determination of the moments and the sheets of irrigation necessary in the production of plants in containers. In most of the nurseries in the region it is irrigated according to the experience of the nurseryman and the actual demand of the plants is not considered, which usually translates into an excessive use of the resource, in addition to the costs associated with the distribution of the water. The technique that is approached is called “container weight”, which is economical and simple to operate in a nursery with low infrastructure, common in the region. The work was carried out in the nursery of the Area of Forestry of the Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary, (National University of Río Cuarto) located at 33º06’50’’S and 64º18’08’’O. The methodology consisted of filling and weighing a block of containers for the construction of a scale of weights. The results suggest that an irrigation sheet of 4.1 mm should be replaced when the container block reaches 3,346 g. For the conditions of the experiment, said sheet can be replenished in 38 min with a fixed irrigation equipment. The application of the method allowed to reestablish the necessary sheets in an efficient way, allowing the supplied water to travel the entire root exploration profile, without the need to apply excess sheets. To express its maximum yield potential, &nbsp;corn crop must have , in addition to favorable climatic and edaphic conditions, &nbsp;good sowing quality. This &nbsp;study evaluated how sowing speed (5, 7 and 9 km h-1) and the commercial seeds firming devices (plastic tail and wheel) affect &nbsp;sowing density and seed distribution. Nine treatments were designed in a split plot design. Corn was seeded with a vacuum metering system, measuring plant spacing to determine population and the uniformity of distribution in the sowing line. The results indicate that there isn´t statistically significant interaction between the planting speed and the seed affirming organs for the density and distribution variables.&nbsp; The sowing speed of 9 km h-1 produced lowest density and worst distribution with statistically significant differences. The seed firmers &nbsp;did not produce significant statistical differences in planting density, but it was observed that the tail has a greater deviation of the seed with respect to the wheel and the option without seed firmers in the sowing line. The objectives of this study were to estimate: a) the frequency of occupational accidents in itinere (OAii), b) their associated factors, c) the frequency and type of injuries suffered and d) the number of days off work veterinarians working with large animals in the Province of Buenos Aires. A cross-sectional study was conducted interviewing 106 veterinarians using a structured questionnaire (simple random sampling, error: 6.4%, confidence: 95% and previous frequency: 15%). The statistical analysis included χ2, Fisher’s exact test, Student’s t test and the search for spatial clusters using InfoStat® and SatScan 9.2.®. Most interviewees (78.3%) worked on their own. The means of transportation were trucks (69.8%) and cars (30.2%) covering 44,886.8 ± 24,628 km/ year. Thirty five out of 100 veterinarians had suffered OAii, being most frequent on country roads. No statistically significant geographic clusters were detected. More than half of the drivers (56.8%) identified more than one factor associated with the OAii. A variable number of drivers failed to comply with current safety regulations. It is suggested that continuing education programs should include all hazards faced by veterinarians, not only those of biological origin. In the following descriptive work, data obtained during the 2018 foaling season a thoroughbred farm located in the southern region of Cordoba Province were analyzed. Sixteen pregnant mares that foaled between August 3 and October 6 were monitored. The results showed that the gestational length in mares was 360± 10 days as a general average. The second stage of labor culminated in an average of 12 ± 11 minutes. The third stage of labor lasted 1.28 ± 1 hours on average. 31% of mares had milk secretion in udders 30 ± 23 hours before delivery on average. 44% (n = 7) of deliveries occurred without assistance while the remaining (n = 9) received assistance. The infants adopted the sternal position in 2.47 ± 2 minutes, the standing position at 34 ± 17 minutes and released the meconium in 3.28 ± 1.51 hours as a general average, taking as reference the completion of the second stage of labor. Abnormalities were found in low percentages in newborns and umbilical bleeding at birth in 27% (n = 4) of foals. The data presented here show that monitoring in the last days of pregnancy in Thoroughbred mares, as well as, in neonates during the first weeks of life would increase the chances of obtaining a viable foal. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between Helicobacter spp and the functionality of bombesin-producing cells in gastric biopsies of pigs. The presence of Helicobacter&nbsp; spp was determined in gastric samples from the antro-pyloric region of mixed-breed pigs. They were colored with Hematoxylin/Eosin for the diagnosis of gastritis, finding a higher proportion of chronic than acute lesions. The presence of Helicobacter was carried out by means of Gi-emsa and Warthin-Starry staining, determining the presence of, at least, two species colonizing the stomach of the pig: one of larger size, intensely spiral He-licobacter heilmannii); and another of smaller size, in the form of “s” italic (He-licobacter&nbsp; pylori). Helicobacter&nbsp; spp was localized in the epithelium, fossa and gastric glands by immunohistochemistry. The detection of bombesin producing cells was performed by immunohistochemical techniques and its percentage was determined in samples with acute and chronic gastritis, Helicobacter (+) / (-). These cells were in the glandular epithelium, underlying connective tissue and muscle tissue. Statistically significant difference was observed between the groups: Chronic Gastritis Helicobacter (+) / Acute Gastritis Helicobacter (+) (p = 0.04); Chronic Gastritis Helicobacter (+) / Normal Mucosa (p = 0.02) and in Chronic Gastritis Helicobacter (-) / Normal Mucosa (p = 0.005). The group with the highest number of bombesin positive cells was that of Gastritis Acute Heli-cobacter (+), whose cell morphology was closed type.\n",

Mathematics and philosophy are two words with different meanings and the same thing. With various historical evidence, mathematics as the basis of science is not part of or born from philosophy. In the same position in knowledge, mathematics confirm the answers to intimate problem in philosophy. Often there is confusion in philosophy because of conflicting concepts with one another. Mathematics without philosophy does not move swiftly, because without the meanings that are sometimes driven by philosophy. Logically, truth is not well developed in evidence except when mathematics and philosophy get long. It is to provide an understanding of the need for a foundation of truth thought, which generally reveals in the comprehension of mathematics, namely in meta-mathematics and philosophy.

The data collection technique uses objective tests, while the instruments used are tests in the form of essays. The results showed that there was an influence on the ability of mathematical problem solving between the experimental groups by applying the problem based learning model and the control group with the direct intruction model. This is evidenced from the results of the t-test at the 5% significance level obtained by the calculated significance of 0.939 <0.05. Whereas for the increase, the results of the t-test at the 5% significance level obtained a calculated significance lower than 0.05, namely 0.02 <0.05, so that it can be stated that learning with the Problem Based Learning model has an effect on improving mathematical problem solving skills. The purpose of this study is to duscribe the factors of the low of social science learning outcomes History subject in V class in SDN Panancangan 4 Kota Serang. The materials of this study is descriptive qualitative methods, the Data collectid by observation, interviews, documentation, and student learning outcomes. Students who have low learning outcomes on average as much as 92% of students with the types of difficulties include: lack of student understanding in historical material, student lack of active in asking, then students\\' inability to remember material such as (mentioning names, years of administration and inheritance), and inappropriate learning strategies. The results of the study shows that generally of the low social studies learning outcomes classified into two factors that is internal and external factors, namely the factors found in students such as psychological factors in learning, motivation and concentration of learning. In addition, there are factors that exist outside of the student\\'s self or external factors, such as the quality of parentid advisionary learning outside of school. Although the learning outcomes obtained by students are more dependent on the students themselves, it is hoped that the instructors will play a role in enhancing them, namely directing students to be able to prepare themselves physically and mentally, increase student learning concentration, give students motivation to learn, teach them strategies - learning strategies, how to be able to learn according to each style, study thoroughly, and get used to sharing with each other.

The result of chi-square test shows that p (0,007) &lt;0,05 there is influence of economic problem with stress of elderly, p (0,007) &lt;0,05, meaning there is influence between socio-cultural problem with stress elderly, p (0,024) &lt;0, 05, meaning there is influence between health problems with stress elderly, p (0,014) &lt;0,05, meaning there is significant influence between psychological problem with stress of elderly. From the results of the study can be concluded that from 30 elderly people who experience the stress of elderly there are several factors that influence the economic problems, socio-cultural issues, health problems, and psychological problems. It is expected that medical personnel should improve the quality of health service for the elderly and for the students to dig more knowledge about factors that influence stress to the elderly, to be able to apply it in health service duty. In supply link point of view, a supplier plays an important role in raw material distribution; the scarcity of raw material distribution will bring about the risk for the disturbance in the amount of tapioca production. One of the reasons of the lack of cassava supply is that many cassava farmers postpone harvesting the cassava because they are busy by the end of year. Since cassava does not decompose easily, the farmers are not bothered when they postpone harvesting the cassava. The objective of the research was to find out and to analyze the influence of the number of raw materials, workers’, working hours, and working hours of machines on the amount of production. The research used explanatory research method. The data were gathered by using time series which were obtained from the report of the production within three consecutive years and were analyzed by using multiple regression analysis with an SPSS software program. The result of the research showed that (a) the number of raw materials had positive and significant influence on the amount of tapioca production, (b) workers’ working hours had positive but insignificant influence on the amount of tapioca production, (c) working hours of machines had negative and insignificant influence on the amount of tapioca production, and (d) the number of raw materials, working hours of workers, and working hours of machines simultaneously had positive and significant influence on the amount of production.

      "31 The hydraulic conductivity of a soil is the main parameter that determines its drainage capacity. However, its determination is of great importance for sizing in agricultural drainage systems. To determine the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in the presence of water table through the Auger-Hole. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Manioc and Fruticulture (EMBRAPA), located in the municipality of Cruz das Almas-BA. In order to estimate the hydraulic conductivity, several empirical formulas have been proposed, such as Ernst\\'s, which is the model that most closely approximates the soil situation studied. The hydraulic conductivity values for the studied soil obtained by the Auger-Hole method ranged from 0.24821 to 0.28544 m day-1. With an average value for hydraulic conductivity of 0.266835 m day-¹, being considered slow. The soil under analysis is classified in slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. The Auger-Hole method proved to be practical, fast, safe and easy to handle. Weed control with glyphosate produces damages in plantations of Eucalyptus camaldulensis, although the involved physiological mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. This work aimed at assessing the physiological responses of E. camaldulensis to simulated glyphosate drift. Greenhouse trials were performed with four-month-old E. camaldulensis clone117 seedlings. The herbicide drift was simulated applying doses of 0; 43,2; 86,4; 172,8 and 345,6 g a.e. ha−1 glyphosate. Twenty-three days after the application, we measured gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence. We also quantified Rubisco activity and indicator variables of oxidative stress. Glyphosate decreased carbon photosynthetic assimilation, increased non-photochemical quenching, induced stomatal closure, and increased photoinhibition. It also decreased Rubisco activity and increased photorespiration. The herbicide produced oxidative stress, and increased the activities in the enzymes catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. We concluded that glyphosate´s deleterious effects on the assimilation of CO2 in E. camaldulensis are due to stomatal and non-stomatal effects. The decrease in Rubisco activity, the increase in photorespiration, and photoinhibition stand out among non-stomatal effects. The increase in the activity of the antioxidant system is insufficient to compensate for the production of H2O2 in photorespiration, which damages the photosynthetic apparatus. This study sought to classify the productivity of a representative area of tropical forest, as well as to analyze the relationship between the structural variability of pioneer species and the yield of three management regimes. The study area is located at the Tropical Forestry Experimental Station belonging to INPA (National Institute for Amazon Research), approximately 90 km from downtown Manaus, in the State of Amazonas, Brazil. Data were collected from twelve 1 ha sample plots. Diameter was measured annually for all individuals with DBH 10 cm between the years 1990 and 2008. Pioneer species served as the basis for calculating the Diameter Variability Index VI% over time. Three classes of variability were established according to the guide curve technique used for site classification by the dominant height. Biological and probabilistic functions were used to model VI% as a function of time of exploitation, as well as the volumetric yield over time as a function of VI%. There is an inverse relationship between VI% and yield, which allows classification of site yield and conception of global yield models to which present good statistics of precision and adjustment, allowing the prediction of productivity and their dynamics throughout the time.\n",
      "32 No Space for Further Burials is a chilling indictment of the madness of war and our collective complicity in the perpetuation of violence set in Afghanistan in late 2002. The novel’s narrator, a US army medical technician in Afghanistan helping “liberate” the country from the Taliban, has been captured by rebels and thrown into an asylum. The other inmates are a besieged gathering of society’s forgotten and unwanted refugees and derelicts, disabled and different, resilient and maddened, struggling to survive the lunacy raging outside the asylum compound. The novel becomes a powerful evocation of the country’s desolate history of plunder and war, waged by insiders and outsiders, all fueled by ideology, desperation, and greed. This astonishingly powerful story unfolds the tragedy of Afghanistan, as told by the captive narrator, in hauntingly beautiful prose. While the characters try to cope with their individual destinies, the terrible madness of war is counterpointed with the poignancy of their lives and the narrator’s own peculiar predicament the “victor” now a victim, his ambivalence a metaphor for everything Afghanistan symbolizes. This paper focuses on the process of Code Mixing and Code Switching done by Pakistani singers in their songs. The study discusses how Pakistani musicians are using it as a part of their creativity. The researcher included th eold singers like Ahmad Rushdi, Nazia Hassan along with the new stars Imran Khan, Ali Haider, Abrar ul Haq, and Bilal Saeed to understand the significance of Code-Mixing and Code Switching. Is the essence of Urdu and Punjabi culture in poetry fading away? Is this a public demand or just makes the music more lyrical? This paper contains the answers to these questions in the form of a survey. This paper’s study is about the novel of James Joyce’s “Ulysses” on the subject topic of Gerty MacDowell as Nausicaa in the Eponymous episode. Its aim is basically dealing with the comparison of Joyce’s Gerty MacDowell and Homer’s Nausicaa emphasizing the importance of their interactions with Bloom and Odysseus and a careful examination of the text and comparison with Joyce’s mai nsource, The Odyssey. This study will show the comparison of Nausicaa and Gerty which proves to be unbelievably fundamental to Ulysses and significant to the “Nausicaa” episode. Additionally, Gerty, like Homer’s Nausicaa, is the representation of a female character of the modern period. Comparisons to human performance are often made in quite general and exaggerated terms. Thus, it is important to be able to account for differences accurately. This paper reports a simple, descriptive scheme for comparing translations, which is applied to four Surahs of the Holy Quran and compares the human translation with machine translation. The method applied for the study is qualitative. Within the qualitative domains, one of the four methods of assessment of translation has been adopted from Waddington (2001). The analysis is done on four parameters namely textual, syntactic, semantic, and social. The results obtained from the data confirm that human translation is far better and superior in comparison with the machine translation as human translation almost covers the four above-mentioned aspects. On the other hand, machine translation lacks and misses many important levels of translation and does not convey the true spirit of meaning from one language to another language. However, machine translation is quicker and faster as compared to human translation. It is concluded that machine translation is not as reliable, trustworthy, and dependable as human translation. This study has a future prospect for further studies with some limitations of human translation. The study of literature, nowadays, has shifted the focus, from the element terms to the criticism. That is, the study of literary works is no longer only focused on the analysis of plot, setting, character, or symbolism but has been broader to the area of criticism. Many critics had taken the critical approaches such as: Objective Approach, Subjective Approach, Historical Approach, Biographical Approach, Psychological Approach, and Feminist Approach to interpret, evaluate, and understand an author\\'s life and works to study literature. Many critics have mainly concerned themselves with issues such as the themes and references that Sylvia has used in her poem, Daddy. Colm Toibin begins his incisive, revelatory Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know with a walk through the Dublin streets where he went to university, a wideeyed boy from the country and where three Irish literary giants also came of age. Oscar Wilde, writing about his relationship with his father, William Wilde, stated: “Whenever there is hatred between two people there is bond or brotherhood of some kind…you loathed each other not because you were so different but because you were so alike.” W.B. Yeats wrote of his father, John Butler Yeats, a painter: “It is this infirmity of will which has prevented him from finishing his pictures. The qualities I think necessary to success in art or life seemed to him egotism.” John Stanislaus Joyce, James’s father, was perhaps the most quintessentially Irish, widely loved, garrulous, a singer, and drinker with a volatile temper, who drove his son from Ireland. Elegant, profound, and riveting, Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know illuminates not only the complex relationships between three of the greatest writers in the English language and their fathers, but also illustrates the surprising ways these men surface in their work. Through these stories of fathers and sons, Toibin recounts the resistance to English cultural domination, the birth of modern Irish cultural identity, and the extraordinary contributions of these complex and masterful authors. This Study attempts to shed light on a syntactic phenomenon that are used by many speakers which is called passive voice. The aim of this study is to show the construction varieties of this phenomenon in order to be easier for learners of aforeign language. It is argued that passive construction has a variety of construction. To examine this, different kinds of constructions with different tenses have been introduced. The paper concludes with some valuable remarks and suggestions that can be helpful for linguists, instructors and learners of English as a foreign language. A sweeping historical novel about a dancehall girl and an orphan boy whose fates entangle over an old Chinese superstition about men who turn into tigers. When 11-year-old Ren\\'s master dies, he makes one last request of his Chinese houseboy: that Ren find his severed finger, lost years ago in an accident, and reunite it with his body. Ren has 49 days, or else his master\\'s soul will roam the earth, unable to rest in peace. Ji Lin always wanted to be a doctor, but as a girl in 1930s Malaysia, apprentice dressmaker is a more suitable occupation. Secretly, though, Ji Lin also moonlights as a dancehall girl to help pay off her beloved mother\\'s Mahjong debts. One night, Ji Lin\\'s dance partner leaves her with a gruesome souvenir: a severed finger. Convinced the finger is bad luck, Ji Lin enlists the help of her erstwhile stepbrother to return it to its rightful owner. As the 49 days tick down, and a prowling tiger wreaks havoc on the town, Ji Lin and Ren\\'s lives intertwine in ways they could never have imagined. Propulsive and lushly written, The Night Tiger explores colonialism and independence, ancient superstition and modern ambition, sibling rivalry and first love. Braided through with Chinese folklore and a tantalizing mystery, this novel is a page-turner of the highest order. This research is about finding out the pre-colonial stance in Hanif Qureshi’s short story ‘My Son the Fanatic” which will reveal how the people after colonization are trying to find out their lost identities. In the modern world with the increase of immigrant numbers, hybrid nations, and constitution of countries with different cultural diversities the question of finding out to the lost identity came to the surface. The researcher will explain what pre-colonial stance actually is who is its beneficiary and how he can be rationalized and justified. This research is unique in its essence as no allied work has been found on the particular text or the writer. The research will make an attempt to critically analyze the text of the selected short story and provide a deep insight into the conflicts encompassing the mind sets of the characters that will help us to understand the pre-colonial stance depicted by the writer in the selected story. This paper is a study about the American writer Francis Scott Fitzgerald and his splendid and extraordinary novel “The Great Gatsby”. In this novel I will be stressing some crucial points regarding colors and symbolism inside the novel. I will analyze these topics and elaborate on them thoroughly its colors and symbolism. F.S. Fitzgerald has a prominent style, an important part of which is color symbolism, especially notable in The Great Gatsby, in every chapter of this novel. The writer is simultaneously a painter who makes his writing very visual and bright, as he mostly uses pure colors, not shades, to make the picture clear. Recent literary movements have modified literature on a global scale. Persian literature after experiencing the invasion of social and cultural changes has recently responded well to postmodern theories and notions. The play, Verb (2017), can be an obvious example of this change since all aspects of postmodern drama are vividly observed in this play. The main purpose of this study is to cast light on Rezae Rad’s Verb from Derrida’s post structuralism viewpoints.Throughout the play, the defined terms and concepts concerning language system are questioned by a Persian language teacher who is the protagonist throughout the play. The basic concepts, the parts of speech, in the structure of a language, therefore, are introduced as ambiguous pillars of a language; the play also includes the permanent plays of lexis with no ultimate real meaning and is also cantered with a plot story of a naïve but knowledgeable language teacher as well as his love story. It can be said that one of the primary aims in this research is to depict whether or not the transcendental signification of defined signifiers and signified help the protagonist to realize the purpose of language and in general the matter of truth. This observation has long had a significant impact on post structuralism thanks to the fact that the themes of reality and identity have sparked heated debate lately. As Derrida’s supplementation would not be neglected in individuals’ traits, the arrays of understandings can be made from a word, a phrase, a sentence and a clause. In this play, due to this fact, the metaphysics of presence, the term introduced by Derrida, which has been at work perhaps with different wordings since the ancient platonic era, is also observed in this story. The ‘metaphysics of presence’ deemed the result of ‘logocentrism’, ‘difference’, ‘transcendental signified’, ‘post structuralism’ and ‘language’ are the main concepts of this article. Moreover, it should be noted that not only does Rezae’s Verb delineate a vague love story, but it also draws readers’ attention to the impact of scholarly noted literary movements in twenty-first century Western literary approaches in Persian literature as one of its characteristics. This article delves into Verb and discusses how deconstruction can interpret Rezae’s.\n",

      "35 This brief article reports on a collaborative book-borrowing policy between The Brendlinger Library of Montgomery County Community College and the Wissahickon Valley Public Library (WVPL), both located in Blue Bell, PA. Beginning in January 2013, WVPL will donate books periodically to the Brendlinger Library in support of the students enrolled in Reading classes. Circulation statistics will be reported to WVPL, and the books will be returned to WVPL for sale in the WVPL Friends of the Library book sale. Keywords: academic library; public library, community college library; collaboration; developmental readers; reading programs; reading instruction; literacy; Montgomery County Community College; Wissahickon Valley Public Library Collecting reference statistics is an important facet of academic librarianship. Having accurate, shareable data about the services a library provides is key to understanding the needs of users and highlighting the importance of the library within the overall institution. While many libraries collect reference statistics on paper, gathering this data using an electronic statistics system is an efficient and customizable way to track and analyze reference service trends. By detailing Neumann University Library and Harrell Health Sciences Library’s experiences with two different but equally effective systems, this article will explore the complexities of implementing, customizing, and analyzing the data from an electronic reference statistics system. The authors also discuss challenges encountered and offer recommendations and best practices for others wishing to explore electronic reference statistic collection. When the Mansfield University library’s Special Events and Customer Service Committee created a communications plan for the library, the opportunity presented itself to overhaul the library signs. Applying basic design principles of contrast, alignment, and repetition along with standards from the Americans with Disabilities Act, the library improved the visual communications within the library. Patrons can now read signs from a distance and understand their purpose. Using common design elements, the library began presenting official library information more cohesively. Extending beyond signs, these design principles are now part of the library’s print publications and promotional items. With this consistency, the library brand is more easily recognizable both within the library and across campus. This article describes some basic elements of design and the process of redesigning the signs. Libraries have struggled with connecting a plethora of content and the metadata stored in catalogs to patrons. Adding more value to catalogs, more tools for reference librarians, and enriched patron search, linked data is a means to connect more people with more relevant information. With the recent transition to the Resource Description and Access (RDA) cataloging standard within libraries, linking data in library databases has become a much easier project to tackle, largely because of another standard called Resource Description Framework (RDF). Both focus on resource description and both are components of linked data within the library. Tying them together is the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) conceptual framework. Acknowledging that linked data components are most likely new to many librarians, this article seeks to explain what linked data is, how RDA and RDF are connected by FRBR, and how knowledge maps may improve information access. Libraries have increasingly adopted social media as an integral means of connecting with their users. However, social media presents many potential concerns regarding library patron privacy. This article presents the findings from a study of how librarians and library staff perceive and handle issues of patron privacy related to social media marketing in libraries. The study reports the results from a mixed-methods online survey, which used a nonprobability self-selection sampling method to collect responses from individuals employed by libraries, without restrictions on position or library type. Nearly three-quarters of respondents reported working in libraries that have either an official or unofficial social media policy. Approximately 53% of those policies mention patron privacy. The findings suggest that many respondents’ views and practices are influenced by the perception of the library’s physical space and social media presence as public places. The findings also suggest a lack of consensus regarding the extent of the library’s obligation to protect patron privacy on library social media sites and what would constitute a violation of privacy. In 2016, a Pennsylvania Library Association Leadership Academy group, with the guidance of their mentors, was assigned to develop a podcast program featuring outstanding Pennsylvania librarians. The group of geographically dispersed librarians, representing different types of libraries, worked together to overcome their limited knowledge of podcasting. In the first few months after receiving the assignment, the team developed a method for identifying interviewees, employed freely available technology to record, edit, and host the podcast, and promoted the final podcast product, PaLAunchPod on February 1, 2017. With 6 full episodes (including a two-part episode) completed, the original podcast team entrusted its work to a new group of Leadership Academy program librarians. A journal club is one means for those in similar professions or practices to read, discuss, and keep up with professional literature with colleagues. Journal clubs are most frequently associated with the medical professions; however, many professionals, including librarians, can benefit from the reading of research and the subsequent discussions and camaraderie that a journal club can elicit. This article describes the launch of a statewide virtual journal club for librarians in Pennsylvania. Now in its third series, the Pennsylvania Library Association (PaLA) College & Research Division (CRD) journal club has given those who’ve participated the opportunity to designate time for professional reading, reflect on personal practice, discuss and exchange theoretical and practical ideas, and connect with librarians across the state. This article reports on the design process and initial results of a project to create a board game, Argument Architect, that bridges the gap between librarians’ and students’ understanding of research and rhetoric. Some students perceive research as a step-by-step, linear process; in contrast, however, most librarians view it as an iterative, dynamic activity. In order to use Argument Architect as a springboard to a classroom conversation, we designed it to avoid the competitive/destructive nature of most board games in favor of a cooperative/constructive schema that fostered a flowing, playful, and reflective dialog between students and librarians about the “messy” nature of research. We also kept in mind our practical needs, as instruction librarians, for a game with flexibility, scalability, portability, and intuitive play that we could efficiently deploy multiple times in composition classes with different class lengths and assignments. We share details and images of the game in multiple stages of development, student and instructor reactions, and future plans. Alison S. Gregory has been named Lycoming College’s Associate Dean and Director of Library Services at the John G. Snowden Memorial Library, according to an announcement by Dr. Phil Sprunger, Provost and Dean of the college. She began her duties July 1, having served the college since 2005 as Assistant Professor and Instructional Services Librarian and Coordinator of Information Literacy and Outreach. She is replacing Janet McNeil Hurlbert, who retired at the conclusion of the 2012-13 academic year. A commentary on the current generational hype about Millennials in the workforce, especially regarding mentoring programs. Mentoring programs have been targeted as needing to change because of the perception that the Millennial cohort is very different from other age cohorts, and this author sets out to prove otherwise. Communication and compatibility between the mentor and mentee are indicators in whether that relationship is successful or unsuccessful. Also discussed is a mentoring program which has recently been expanded at the Pennsylvania State University Libraries. Remodeling of a building and decreased shelf space motivated faculty and staff to complete a long overdue weeding project in a small university library. Librarians used social media, internal communication, and personal contact to motivate faculty. Every effort was made to reuse and recycle discarded materials. The result was a streamlined collection and a much improved learning space.\n",
      "36 The main cellular determinants of cardiac automaticity are the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current If, and the electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchanger which generates an inward current after each action potential (AP). Our goal was to evaluate their relative role in pacemaking, by means of application of Ivabradine (IVA) (specific If blocker) and Ryanodine (RYA) (known to abolish calcium transient) on enzimatically isolated guinea-pig pacemaker cells. Spontaneous APs were recorded in patch-clamp whole cell configuration at 36&deg;C from 7 cells perfused with the following sequence of solutions: physiological normal tyrode (NT), IVA 3 mM, NT and RYA 3 mM. Cycle length (CL, ms) and diastolic depolarization rate (DDR, V/s) were also calculated. Both blockers displayed similar effects, increasing CL (by 27 and 30%, respectively), and decreasing DDR (by 34 and 42%) with respect to NT exposure. These results suggest that both mechanisms are involved into pacemaking mechanism at a similar degree. Recent research on the contiguity between man and animal provides strong evidence for the studies carried out by Paolo Sotgiu Institute for Research in Quantitative &amp; Quantum Psychiatry &amp; Cardiology, L.U.de.S. University, Lugano, Switzerland, in collaboration with the Department of Veterinary Medical Science, University of Bologna, Italy. The works, co- ordinated by Prof. Massimo Cocchi &ndash; Paolo Sotgiu Institute Scientific Director &ndash; have underlined this continuity, especially as to the relationship between man and dog, not only from an evolutionary point of view, but rather from a molecular perspective. For the study of genetic changes that occur over time in human communities (microevolution) anthropologists and biodemographers have favored the use of renewable flow, in particular the registers of marriage. Indeed they allow to easily estimate several biodemographic parameters (endogamy and exogamy; repeated pairs; immigration), even for long periods of time, since it is quite common to have consecutive series of documents relating to the marriage of a population. However, the sources of flow do not always allow to study in depth the factors that have given continuity to the community because they provide only partial information on demographic structure, the mode of aggregation of its members and the processes of change within families. A good alternative to sources of flow may be the use of sources of state, civil (censuses) or parish sources (the status animarum), which give a very detailed picture of the state of the population at a given time. The retrieval and analysis of census documentation assume therefore a primary role in order to obviate the intrinsic weaknesses of the sources of flow. In the perspective of biodemographic studies, the integration of the two types of sources is in actual fact the operating optimum. It must be remembered that it is quite difficult to find contemporary sources of flow and of state for the Italian populations of the past. Previously, we observed that a single low-intensity premature ventricular stimulation could occasionally induce spontaneous ectopic beats in normal rat hearts. Possible hypothesis for the arrhythmia is that a premature beat can encounter a zone of conduction block to initiate reentry. However, enhanced dispersion of repolarization, a necessary condition for initiation of reentry, is unlikely to be present in normal myocardium. Thus, the main objective of the present study was to perform detailed pace mapping measurements in normal ventricular myocardium with a view to identify pacing sites and critical coupling intervals which could induce spontaneous ectopic beats and to characterize the reentrant circuits. Although biodemography prefers to focus on isolated human populations, in our analysis we have considered an opened community, neither culturally nor geographically separated from the nearby communities. The aim of the present study was to reconstruct the degree of consanguinity and assess the level of openness of a certain French population through the observation of its people&rsquo;s matrimonial behavior. Marriages and, in general, the choice of the partner, are often affected by culture and society which affect, in the end, the community&rsquo;s genic pool. Stature is fundamental in personal identification for forensic and physical anthropologists. When a full skeleton is not available, stature can be estimated from incomplete human remains. It is also important to apply a method to estimate the stature based on the same specific population of the remains. For this purpose, we measured 4 distances between cephalometric landmarks of the mandible and the stature in 56 subjects (both males and females) from Caucasian Italian population. The correlation between these parameters appeared to be statistically significant, so that it was possible to establish a regression equation to estimate the stature from the mandible in this population. In the framework of the Risk Assessment procedure for the ecotoxicological evaluation of compounds used in the aquatic environment, tests with target species must be carried out. This paper reports the results concerning the evaluation of the acute toxicity of F-500 micelle encapsulator (Hazard Control Technologies Inc., Fayetteville, GA, USA) on cladocerans Daphnia magna, with the purpose to verify its compatibility for the aquatic environment and its adequacy for the remediation of soils polluted with hydrocarbons. The obtained results show that by adding F-500 to diesel-polluted soils, the toxicity on Daphnia magna decreases remarkably, indicating the usefulness of this compound to fight the environmental pollution consequent to hydrocarbon dumping. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of conditions, each of which represents a risk factor for cardiovascular disease: central obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension. In different recent studies, MetS has been associated with an accelerate cognitive decline in the elderly. The aim of our research was to investigate the relationship between MetS and cognitive performance in 174 Italian elderly people living in Val Cenischia (Piedmont, Italy). Mini mental state examination (MMSE) has been administered to assess the cognitive status of all participants. The prevalence of MetS is 50.3% (51.3 and 49.5% for males and females, respectively). Our results confirm the association between MetS and worse cognitive performance in the elderly: an increased number of MetS components is associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive impairment (odds ratio=1.54; confidence interval 95%:1.04-2.28; P&lt;0.05). Some dynastic and pre-dynastic Egyptian mummies from the Giovanni Marro Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, University of Turin, Italy have been studied by means of the combined approach of both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and histological analysis, with the aim of investigating the preservation state of the skin of ancient archaeological remains, as a consequence of the differences between the two kinds of mummification processes, i.e. natural and by means of embalming substances. The results suggest that the balms used in the dynastic mummies embalming process really could have played an important role in the prevention of corpse deterioration. A compact three-dimensional representation of cardiac action potential (AP) properties in terms of current source is presented here. The experimental protocol used to obtain such representation is based on the measure of instantaneous current-voltage relationships during the course of the AP. The procedure, which combines current- and voltage-clamps on patch clamped cardiac myocytes, has been previously applied to real cells, and then extended to computer simulations with cellular ventricular AP models. The three-dimensional AP representation allows to easily estimate membrane resistance during repolarization, a key factor for the modulation of ventricular repolarization. It also shows that, during late ventricular repolarization, membrane conductance becomes negative, i.e. repolarization is auto-regenerative. The novel AP representation is therefore a useful tool for both in vivo and in silico cardiac cellular electrophysiological investigations. We report the effects of K:D-Rib, a D-ribose and KHCO3 water solution on HTB-126 human cancer cell line proliferation and the preliminary ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) measures of DNAzyme as biosensor of extracellular K+ concentration. On the one hand, we demonstrate that the synergic action of KHCO3 and D-ribose from one side has a cytostatic effect on human breast cancer cell line increasing by 30% the doubling population time of treated cells with respect to the control; and on the other hand we demonstrate how it seems to permit the K+ uptake.\n",
      "37 With the plethora of social networks, a new form of autobiographical narrative is becoming popular, in which technological elements are mixed with a new narrative. Among the major changes taking place in this new environment we can consider the extension of autobiographical narratives to an exponentially larger audience, even anonymous people; the technological mediation of the platforms, which follows a predefined kind of subject in terms of options allowed by the means of self-expression; and the leap from the virtual identity as a mean of concealment to a conception of the self-representation on the internet that operates under the principles of authenticity and interaction. As well, unlike other previous forms of expression, in these profiles we find that resources such as hypertext take a major part of the life story and the self-representation, which is embodied in a concept of online identity in which social and qualitative aspects prevail. This paper provides a comparative analysisâ€”from a semiotic perspectiveâ€” of different individual profiles on various social networks, both in content and in mediation techniques from different websites, relating them to the ability to implement a narrative construction of the subjectivity of the user, and also with other practices that interact with that ability, such as changes that take place in family or job, the existence of fragmented biographies, and to what extent there are assumptions that prevail in that construction (biographical consistency or collage format). This article discusses the results of a long-term research (2011-2012) on social networks used by Spanish pre-university young people, which was conducted by researchers at the Universidad Complutense (Madrid). The research project, funded by TelefÃ³nica SA, analizes a sample of 400 pre-university students in Madrid using a quantitative analysis method, so as to establish uses, motivations and time-consuming habits concerning the main Spainâ€™s social networking. It developed also focus groups and qualitative interpretation of the results, as well as the connection with existing theories about networks and primary communication groups. The main conclusion is the emergence of a new axis of socialization, not comparable with the primary communication processes, and complementary to other distant or secondary processes such as cultural communication and education. Social networking sites turn out to be a vital factor in the integration of young people into cultural, social, and symbolic distant universes, making possible to establish new forms of contact. This phenomenon is set to revolutionize interpersonal human communication. This article summarizes the main points in an ongoing investigation for a magister thesis, which, from a perspective focused on the social production of meaning, proposes an analysis of the ways in which the figure of â€œthe neighborsâ€ acquires importance in light of political processes and urban transformations in the City of Buenos Aires during the 2007-2011 period. In this context, â€œthe neighborsâ€ is erected as a legitimate actor in demands towards the authorities, while, in its name, the local administration executes interventions and urban transformations. Various discourses are characterized in this investigation: vecinalista (neighborhood-centered), securitario (security-centered), and patriomonialambientalista (environmental-patrimonial). It is argued that, contrary to the belief that the term â€œneighborsâ€ refers in some general sense to the â€œinhabitants of a city,â€ in each of the aforementioned discourses this term is constructed in several ways, according to the demands of the discourse, according to its relationship to other figures (â€œpoliticiansâ€, â€œcompaniesâ€, â€œcriminalsâ€, â€œstreet vendorsâ€, etc.), and according to conceptions about politics and the city. The present analysis is based on statements from self-defined neighborhood groups, as well as actors linked at various levels to local government. At the theoretical level, this project aims to study questions concerning the relationship between political identities and conceptions of space, as well as the links between discourse, politics, and subjectivity Purpose: The main objective of this study is to achieve an empirical measurement of Yagmourâ€™s brand image, an Argentine firm, using the Corporate Character Scale (or corporate personality scale) developed by Davies et al. (2004). Among respondents, itâ€™s planned to identify consumer segments based on the Corporative Character Scale dimensions. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from an on-line customer survey to 657 women who reside in the city of Buenos Aires and the suburbs (â€œGreat Buenos Airesâ€). For the data analysis and personality scale redefinition, Structural Equation Modeling or SEM was used. By means of cluster and discriminant analysis the women surveyed (active customer of the brand) were segmented according to their personality perceptions of the brand. Findings: In order to achieve good measurement properties, only three of the seven proposed scale dimensions remained and these had to be refined so as to achieve reliability and convergent/discriminant validity. Among respondents, three female segments were clearly identified: the distant, the enthusiasts and the apathetic. Originality/value: While the study of corporate brand personality using factorial scales â€”such the ones developed by Aaker (1997) or Davies et al. (2004)â€” covered a wide range of products and services in different countries, the main value of the current investigation is to become a leading consumer research for the corporate brand personality field in Argentina. This paper is a preview of a research where we aim to describe young people practices of cultural consumption and production in social media. We have chosen this universe because we believe that nowadays trans-media practices of young people are located more on social and entertainment activities than it happens with other ages. In this article we explain a set of concepts that will allow us to focus the problem in order to develop the field research. The concept of practice allows us to treat other closely related concepts. The social use of technology, i.e., the invention of new practices to develop different tasks is closely related to consumption, understood as the set of social processes of symbolic and material products appropriation. In this way, different habitus (Bourdieu, 1988) are developed that promote preferences, operational patterns, ways of doing and thinking. Shirky (2008) focuses on the transition from a one-to-many communication model (typical of broadcasting) to the many-to-many type, that occurs in new media and the kind of contents they distribute. Shirky believes that the production of new types of contents by young people is possible due to a process of massive amateurization. They no longer need to be professional editors so as to be able to publish online. Now a set of expressive skills moves from a group of professionals to the whole society in a ubiquitous way. These skills are available to multiple audiences/users who propose and explore new ways of communicating and coordinating, without having to ask permission before doing it. In recent years, the hospital context has been subjected to several changes, among them, those caused by the increased interest people have shown towards health issues, technological development, and the implementation of the Internet, especially Web 2.0 tools (blogs, social media, etc.). This situation presents a challenge for hospitals, characterized by a limited tradition in professional management of institutional communications. Web 2.0 tools offer an opportunity for hospitals to implement institutional communication strategies that might enable them to improve their communicative relationships with different stakeholders. The objective of this paper, which reviews the available literature, is to understand the main criteria that must be considered by a hospital in order to determine its strategy of institutional communications 2.0. The conclusions arrived at by this paper indicate that these criteria should be five: 1) combine the commercial approach with a pedagogical approach focused on educating the patient on health issues; 2) involve health professionals; 3) complement communications 2.0 with interpersonal face-to-face communications held within the hospital; 4) adapt communications 2.0 strategies to the hospitalâ€™s institutional communication norms; and 5) respect communication and hospital ethics. Argentina has a long journalistic tradition, with academic institutions that are pioneers in the profession. Nevertheless, the development of studies on journalism remains incipient, which is evinced by the few systematic studies that allow for a diagnosis of the professionâ€™s situation in the country. Studies based on sample surveys concentrate on the last fifteen years and spring, in large part, from the efforts of civil society. In the majority of cases, they were conceived by consultants with the participation of a few universities. Although diverse in reach and focus, almost all of these investigations agree on the scarcity, not only of references to the journalistsâ€™ situation, but also of data that can adequately measure the universe of the profession. Because of this, most surveys are principally centered on the journalists of mainstream media from the capital city, who are accessible and measurable but not representative of the entire field. With these antecedents, the available investigations are presented as exploratory interviews, while their results are given a provisional status. The lack of statistical data on working professionals could be attributed to a dearth of centralized registries due to the low participation of journalists in labor unions and civil society. Also influential is the fact that the theoretical frameworks common to the sociology of editorial staffs and to studies of news production have only recently began to be disseminated across the country within the last decade. This weakness in the epistemological base has diversified the methodologies employed for broaching the problem, which have not always been adequate in providing a general diagnosis of the profession, which is still pending. Researchers agree that corporate reputation is one of the most valuable intangible assets owned by an organization (in the present study, the terms reputation and corporate reputation will be used interchangeably). Since the management of reputation inevitably requires that it can be measured, this research advances the main decision-making criteria and the challenges involved in choosing or developing a tool that measures corporate reputation.This document demonstrates that, just as there is no single criteria to define corporate reputation, there is likewise no single criteria for measuring it in the professional and academic fields. Also, through a systematic process of analysis examining previous investigations, this document shines a light on areas that still require future investigations and agreement. The history of the popularization of science in Argentina is rich in formats, texts, and authors, many of whom remain unknown even today. The aim of this paper is to examine the conditions of production, circulation, and reception surrounding the articles written by a cordovan astronomer for La NaciÃ³n newspaper during almost forty years. His work began approximately in 1906 or 1907, and it was both continuous and successful. Despite this fact, he has been forgotten, perhaps because he adhered to a theory disparaged by his contemporary scientific community, and which could still be discredited in modern times. Nevertheless, his work was determined by factors that converged to shape him into the social figure of a popular scientist. Despite academic rejection, the success of his texts poses questions that this essay hopes to answer through the analysis of his articles. For this purpose, it is important to consider, not only the themes he dealt with, but also his style, which was mindful of the medium he was writing for. His texts show a discursive dynamic centered on the explanation of phenomena related to astronomy, but which never ignores a global discursive strategy that calls for pleasing and attractive reading. This article intends to indentify and analyze key subjects in the contemporary investigation of political communication in Latin America. The premise of this analysis is that the study of media and political processes in Latin America helps to understand the contributions of regional studies to the rest of the field. Although the role of regional studies has been extensively debated in politics and in comparative sociology (Bates, 1997; Hall &amp; Tarrow, 1998), it still has not been sufficiently discussed either in political communication or in the field of communication. This is especially surprising considering the great number of studies dedicated to international topics as well as the predominance of globalization debates within the field of communication during the last two years. Upon this foundation, the analysis is organized around three themes central to current investigations about the region: the mediatization of politics, the challenges faced by media democracy,\n",
      "38 One of the prevention efforts of medical errors that occur in health services is by identifying the potential failure of the service before the failure occurs. FMEA is one way to identify the risks of failure. Therefore, the authors wanted to find out whether FMEA was effective for reducing medical error based on previous studies. This article was a literature review using references in an online database such as EBSCOhost. The author found 280 articles while searching by using the keyword “FMEA”. After filtered by publication period from 2012 to 2017, full text and language, finally got 7 articles. Finally, the author used the three most relevant literature. FMEA was proven to decrease the potential failure rate after follow-up to failure was done in service process, so medical error can be prevented. In the application of FMEA, bias can occur during the determination of potential failure and determination of scoring on RPN. Therefore, it is expected that the team involved in making FMEA experts in the process of service to be designed. FMEA could prevent medical errors by determining potential failures before failure occurs. Abstract. A favorable work environment will influence the quality of work life, would create quality human resources, and support the improvements in the quality of services. To discover the correlation betweem the quality of work life and the employees’ performance at Ogan Ilir District General Hospital, a study was performed in March-April 2018. The study was a cross sectional quantitative study on 315 civil servants and voluntary staff at the hospital. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis was performed using the chi-square and the double regression prediction/determinant model. We discovered that the quality of the work life at the hospital was lacking, particularly for pride in their place of work, employee involvement/participation, and the facilities provided to the employees. It was also discovered that of the 315 employees, 164 (51.1%) employees had low performance index and there was a significant correlation between the employee involvement/participation and the facilities provided to the employees with their performance. Therefore, the three components that was correlated strongly with employee performance was employee involvement/participation [Odds Ratio (OR): 2.190, Confidence Interval (CI): 95%, P <0.001], facilities provided (OR: 2.670; CI 95%, p < 0.000), and work safety (OR: 0.972, CI 95%, p = 0.911). The process to establish a planning and budgeting policy in the Directorate for Occupational and Sports Health is very dynamic and it fluctuates according to the goals and priorities of the policy. This research aims to ascertain how far the political aspects influences the establishment process. This research was a qualitative research accomllished through in-depth interviews with related parties. The framework used the planning and budgeting systems model and process/cycle. Results of this research indicated that politics played a major role in the policy establishment process in conflicts, cooperation, and negotiations when setting the size and allocation of the budget and the targets aimed. The main points in the process are the priorities of the program, the fiscal capacity of the nation, and the results of the previous year’s evaluation. We recommend that the human resources of the directorate are equipped abilities to advocate the importance of the occupational and sports health program By 2015 the deaths due to PTM are 68% and projected in 2030 to increase to 74%. Indonesia in 2013 based on Riskesdas data shows that 69.6% of diabetes mellitus and 63.2% of hypertension are still undiagnosed. The government\\'s proactive efforts are through the implementation of Posbindu PTM which shows a very different number of visits in the target area of the Pasir Mulya Public Health Center. The purpose of this study is to know more in the description of management, communication, partnership and innovation in the implementation of Posbindu PTM and the factors that determine the results of the evaluation of the implementation of Posbindu PTM. This study is a qualitative study with in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), document review and observation at two Posbindu PTM with the highest and lowest visits to people with similar characteristics. The results of this study indicate that human resource management is a contributing factor in the implementation of Posbindu PTM, communication and innovation need to be supported by partnership. The implementation of Posbindu PTM is supported by the optimization of management, communication, partnership and innovation factors that are interrelated in improving the successful implementation. AbstractHospital is a public facility that must continue on full operation when a disaster occurs. In any disaster situation that results in a surge in patients, hospitals are expected to provide health services for the victims. This study uses mixed research methods. We combine qualitative methods using in-depth interviews and quantitative methods using questionnaires and hospital safety index scoring. The sample was taken by purposive sampling on hospitals’ management incorporated in the disaster management organization structure. The hospital safety index score result is 62.5%. The knowledge questionnaire results showed 77% percentage, meaning that the staff’s knowledge of disasters was excellent. RSUD Kota Yogyakarta’s Hospital Safety Index result means that it is still in category B. This category means that the hospital still has some risks affecting their maximum function in facing disaster. The rapid change from presidential regulation no.19 year 2016 on health insurance into presidential regulation no.28 year 2016 on health insurance get a big attention. This research was purposed to analyze about health insurance policy which changed very quickly. It changed from presidential regulation no.19 year 2016 into presidential regulation no.28 year 2016 on health insurance. The researcher used qualitative methods. The analysis from the input processing and output showed that the change of presidential regulation is a responsive form from president when he looked public rejection response for the increase of fee. The president extended it through the department of health affairs. In terms of inputs, the resources of this policy change are still very limited, while at the stage of the process there is still a lack of cross-sector coordination with related institutions and difficulties in getting the materials needed in the discussion. Presidential Regulation No.28 of 2016 on Health Insurance that became the output in this change is considered to be able to accommodate the demand of the people but the changes are not in accordance with the actuary calculations. This change of presidential regulation not yet affected to appropriate the fee adequacy on BPJS Implementation. The department of health affairs as a leader of health sector was recommended to increase the cross-sectoral coordination which can manifest the better product of health policy and to complete the policy instrument that yet to be determined. It also used to be concern from the department of health affairs, DJSN and BPJS which explained the increase of fee must be offset by a quality improvement rather than the implementation of national health insurance. Abstract. By late March, to anticipate the spreading of COVID-19 pandemic, the President of the Republic of Indonesia has issued several regulations. The Author has examined that the main laws that were used as the based for the issuance of those regulations are Law No.6 Year 2018 regarding Health Quarantine (the Health Quarantine Law). Therefore in order to handle COVID-19 pandemic, an understanding of the Law become a must. The aim of this research is to elaborate and explain the Health Quarantine Law to reduce the COVID-19 pandemic. This research is normative legal research. The research used secondary data, which consisted of primary legal sources and secondary legal sources. Data were collected through the \\\"google scholar machine\\\". Data obtained were analyzed using a qualitative approach. Findings and analysis proved that besides those newly issued regulations there were several measures and acts that should be taken to handle the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The Author suggests that the Central Government shall take the necessary steps as soon as possible. The capability of the Internal Government Supervisory Apparatus (APIP) is the ability to carry out supervisory tasks consisting of three interrelated elements: capacity, authority, and competence. The objective of this research is to give policy recommendations for enhanced APIP capability in the Inspectorate General of the Ministry of Health. This research is a descriptive study with qualitative analysis method with in-depth interview and literature study. Results of this research indicate that there are some obstacles: the socialization done only to some employees of Itjen; no Special Team on the process of improving APIP capability; the time and task division is unclear; has no special budget yet; there has not been a derivative rule from the Internal Audit Charter (IAC); no reward and punishment system; no documentation of supervision working papers; the policy has not been internalized. This research concludes that the implementation of the policy has not been reached optimally based on PERKA BPKP Number PER-1633/K/JF/2011. Communication is the most influential factor in the implementation of APIP enhancement policy. The recommendation from this research are consistently socialize to employees within the Inspectorate General, make Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), allocate budget activities in 2018, create memorandum of understanding with other agencies, and self-assessment and program evaluation absolutely must do continuously. Abstract. To provide security to their patients, healthcare providers use a system for patient safety which includes risk reporting and analysis of incidents, identification and management of risks, and the ability to learn about events that have occurred. According to the 2017 patient safety data at Prof. Dr. Soerojo Psychiatric Hospital, 7% of patient safety incidents at the hospital required a Root Cause Analysis. To aid the process, an online information system is necessary. This research was qualitative research that used the waterfall method for the information syntax. This involved planning, analysis, design, implementation, and system. From there, the data was then evaluated based on its accessibility, completeness, accuracy, and speed. The qualitative data was gathered through questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and unstructured interviews with selected informants. 26 informants were involved in this research, this included the reporters, the Patient Safety (KPRS) Team, and the hospital management board. Results of the would then produce recommendations on how to handle the problems found. Based on the data gathered, we discovered that after the application of the information system, the hospital experienced a 53.8% increase in patient safety. Schoolchildren are assets for the development of the nation. Therefore, healthy meals at schools are very important, because for them, it covers about 25-36% of the daily energy requirements. Unhealthy eating habits or consumption of nutrition deficient meals may cause stunting, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and osteoporosis. In the short term it may also cause dental caries, anemia, overweight children and obesity. Around 40-44% of meals at schools do not satisfy the food safety requirements. To increase the quality of the meals at the schools, the community should be empowered to perform independent monitoring of school meals. This is inscribed in the national action policy for safe, good-quality, and nutritious meals for schoolchildren. The aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the national action policy for the snacks of schoolchildren and the factors that influences it. This was a qualitative research. The data was gathered from in-depth interviews and documentary studies and then analyzed using the policy implementation analysis of Mazmanian and Sabatier. From this research we discovered that the policy did not perform effectively in Batam City. There were no Procedure Standard Norms NSPK on the roles, tasks, and responsibilities of the implementers, there was no implementation structure, and no support from the Government and the Parliament of Batam City for the monitoring. Abstract. Community Satisfaction Index (CSI) Survey is used to measure the community’s perception on the services that they receive. In hospitals, it is used to determine whether a service or facility needs to be improved or not, and where it must be improved. In 2018, a descriptive qualitative study was performed at RSUD Dr. Kanujoso which would measure the public’s perception on the services that the hospital provided. The survey was based on the 14 aspects of CSI of the State Apparatus Empowerment Minister Decree No.\n",

There are various techniques in reducing spasticity in neurological conditions. Objective- To investigate the literature evidence for the effect of stretching on spasticity in neurological conditions. Data sources- A systematic review of all literature found in last 20 years are related to the different techniques of stretching to reduce spasticity (keywords: stretching, spasticity) from PubMed, Google scholar, Science direct and Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Electronic searching was used to find the source literature using definitive keywords. Conclusion- There are the wide variety of the studies investigating the effect of stretching to relieve spasticity in neurological conditions. The further studies can be done to investigate the long-term effects of stretching to reduce spasticity.\\n&nbsp; Background- : Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are a common cause of morbidity affecting many working individuals. These disorders lower the individual’s productivity and also affect quality of life. Healthcare workers are known to be at a high risk for WMSDs. However, it is one of the least studied occupations. Nursing is a physically demanding profession and WMSDs have been considered as the leading factor for absenteeism among the nursing professionals. Hence the objective of the present research was to study prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in nurses. METHOD: 50 female nurses with a work experience of at least 2 years, having musculoskeletal pain for at least 6 months duration were selected for the study. An observational study was conducted using interview-based questionnaire. Data collected was subjected to statistical analysis. RESULT: Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in nurses was found to be 88%. Low back was found to be the commonest site of pain (70.45%), followed by the knee (56.81%), neck (47.72%), leg (25%), shoulder (6.81%) and elbow (4.54%). CONCLUSION: Study concluded that the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in nurses is high.\\n&nbsp; Background: OA knee is one of the commonest cause of disability in Elderly individuals which can cause functional decline and balance impairment which leads to difficulty in Activities of daily living hence this study was conducted to evaluate the balance and physical function in OA knee patients using simple clinical test so that the patients from the rural area can also evaluated where advanced measures are not available. METHOD: In this cross-sectional observational study, the participants were elderly in community and patients coming to OPD included in convenient sampling both male and female patients with OA knee joint.60 participants were assessed for Balance and Physical function using Mini-BEST and FTSTST respectively and co-relation between Balance and Physical function. RESULT: The results show that the balance and physical function was affected by the OA and the impact was greater according to the severity and also co-relation shows that as the balance impairment was more the ability to perform the physical function was reduced in OA knee patients&nbsp;\\n&nbsp; Background- Spasticity following stroke is often associated with pain, soft tissue stiffness, decreased quality of life, increased treatment cost, and increased caregiver burden. Myofascial release is a new approach to relieve spasticity. It may act in the future as a facilitator and intensifier of treatment for a more consistent effect. Also, Inhibition techniques are used in spastic patients. In tendinous pressure, manual pressure is applied to the tendinous insertion of the muscle or across long tendons produces an inhibitory effect. AIM- To To find the immediate effect of tendinous pressure technique versus myofascial release in the reduction of spasticity. METHOD- The study was conducted in Vikhe Patil Hospital, Physiotherapy OPD, and Phuntamba Stroke Center. It was a cross over study conducted on spastic stroke patients using a purposive sampling method. Twenty-seven patients were included in the study. The duration of the study was of 6 months. Modified Tardieu scale was the outcome measure used at pre, and post-treatment measurement and the subject was treated with both the techniques with 2 hours of the interval to see which of the technique is more beneficial for reducing spasticity. RESULT-Result of within-group analysis of pre and post-treatment measurement of myofascial release showed clinical and statistical significance, but muscle reaction testing (X) showed no significant difference in&nbsp; MTS whereas the result of within-group analysis of pre and post-treatment measurement, and muscle reaction testing (X) of tendinous pressure showed clinical and statistically significant improvement in MTS. The result of between the post-treatment measurement and muscle reaction testing of myofascial release and tendinous pressure showed no significant difference. In contrast, muscle reaction testing showed a significant difference in MTS of both the techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION-So the conclusion can be made that tendinous pressure is more effective as compared to MFR in reducing the spasticity of stroke patients. Background- An observational study was conducted on 60 college going students experiencing nonspecific low back pain of mild to moderate range[ on VAS 2-5].&nbsp; METHOD- Assessment of hamstring and IT band tightness was done by using 90-90 hamstring test and Ober’s test respectively. Participant were checked for tightness and marked whether tightness present or not RESULT- Analysis of outcomes was done by the mean and standard deviation. The result showed that, 58.33% male and 95.85% has female has hamstring muscle tightness.&nbsp; 16.66% Male and 22.91% female has of IT band tightness. 85% population [both male and female] shows of hamstring muscle tightness. While 85 % of male and females both shows hamstring muscle tightness. 21.66% populations [ both M and F] shows of IT band tightness. Conclusion- Study shows the prevalence of hamstring and IT band tightness is present in nonspecific low back pain.&nbsp; In participant hamstring muscle tightness is more profound (85%) than IT band tightness (21.66%).\\n&nbsp; Background AND AIM : The aim of the study was to present a review of studies that investigate the effects of thermal stimulation intervention on sensorimotor recovery in patients with stroke. METHOD: A database of articles published up to the year 2016 were compiled using the following pubmed key words: stroke, thermal stimulation, sensorimotor recovery. References listed in relevant publications were also screened. Studies that satisfied the following selection criteria were included: (1) patients were diagnosed with stroke;(2) effects of thermal stimulation in any form were investigated; (3) the outcome was measured in terms of sensory, motor and functional recovery; and (4) the study was a randomized clinical trial (RCT) or an experimental study. Result: The results were that thermal stimulation in any form is effective in improving the sensorimotor function of both upper as well as lower extremity as thermal stimulation enhances the corticomotor excitability and promotes neuroplasticity. Conclusion: This review of 5 studies provides support for the potential of thermal stimulation on sensorimotor recovery in stroke\\n&nbsp; Background- To date there are very few studies evaluating the relationship between sedentary behaviour and pulmonary function in a population who works for more than half a day i.e. 6-8hrs continuously in front of technologies (mainly desk jobs) with no sign of physical activities. Hence the aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a sedentary lifestyle on peak expiratory flow rate. METHOD- The study was conducted on 75 desk job workers, males and females of age group 30-45 years working for 6-8 hours without physical activity. Analysis of their lung function capacity was done by PEFR. RESULT-It is seen that there is a significant difference in the predicted and obtained values of PEFR in both genders. The mean predicted value of PEFR in females is 416.04±25.72 and the mean obtained value of PEFR is 284.7±72.84. In males the mean predicted value of PEFR is 542.6±23.33 and the mean obtained value of PEFR is 396.2±80.6. It shows that the sedentary lifestyle with physical inactivity affects the PEFR values CONCLUSION-Regular exercise in terms of physical activity is essential for every individual with a sedentary lifestyle to overcome health problems and improve their pulmonary functions.\\n&nbsp; Background- Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. The Knee is the weight-bearing joint most commonly affected by osteoarthritis (OA). The symptoms of pain, morning stiffness of short duration and physical dysfunction in the activities of daily living (ADL) can affect many aspects of health, affecting Quality of life. Regular and moderate physical activity adapted to an individual\\'s life-styles and education, and joint protection strategies have been advocated as conservative management. Quality of life is the condition of life resulting from the combination of the effects of the complete range of factors such as those determining health, happiness, education, social and intellectual attainments, freedom of action, justice and freedom of expression. METHOD– It is a Randomized Clinical Trial. Study done on Geriatric people in Geriatric Home Centre, Vilad Ghat. Ahmednagar. On 20 Samples. After obtaining approval from the Ethical Committee, Informed consent was obtained by each subject after explaining them in their language. Subjects were selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria.&nbsp; The subjects were divided into two groups.&nbsp; Group A: Experimental group consisting of 10 subjects and Group B: Control group consisting of 10 subjects. RESULT- In this study, we found that there was a significant improvement in all the parameters of WOMAC Index. Conclusion- : &nbsp;From the present study we found that there was a significant improvement in the Experimental group than the Control group.\\n&nbsp; There are various growing definitions and perceptions of disability. It leads to various complications leading to independency for all other activities of daily living, making occupational limitations and economically dependent. So there is a need to make them aware of various schemes available in India, for supporting them for various economic, pension and educational scholarship schemes.\\nThe rights and laws of persons with disabilities must, therefore, be understood and studied from a variety of perspectives, including human rights and various other laws in India, which will fill the gap or close the gap between persons with disabilities and persons with disabilities in their personal attainment in the true sense of the term.\\nThroughout this research report, the writer puts a great deal of focus on the different legislative frameworks and regulations existing throughout our country and allows a comprehensive analysis on how such laws have led to the advancement of the legal status of people with disabilities in India.

History is often addressed by most learners as boring subjects. It appears from the passive attitude of learners during the learning process takes place, such as the lack of activity to ask, respond and answer questions from the teacher. Therefore, learning is more on teacher centered patterns, centered on teachers. This is feared to cause misperception-what the teacher tells the learners, so that learners do not fully accept the material well. Such facts encouraged this research. Researchers are trying to improve the learning conditions in X-TKJ SWK Wahdatul Jannah class through the application of historical game card media. The main purpose of this study is to improve the learning activities of learners. Game card game history is packed through group discussions and class discussions. This research is a Class Action Research (PTK), consisting of three cycles. Selection of class X-TKJ SMK Wahdaul Jannah as the object of research dilatari because in the classroom learning process (history) less so interactive, the relationship between teachers with learners. As for the results obtained, the cycle 1 learning activeness of students showed increased learning activeness ranged 54%, cycle 2 learning activeness learners increased 70%, cycle 3 learning activeness learners increased 82%. Thus, the use of history card game media is said to be successful as an effort to improve the learning activities of learners. Indonesia is a country with diverse cultures that live side by side in it. There are various factors that influence the diversity of cultures that Indonesia has, one of which is the influence of foreign parties, it has been known that Indonesia was once influenced by Hindu and Buddhist culture in a long period of time and has instilled cultural values ​​in Indonesia, after influence Hindu and Buddhist culture declined, came new cultures and influences brought by Islam. The arrival of Islam in the form of the influence of religion and culture does not necessarily erase the Indonesian original culture or culture resulting from the acculturation of Hinduism and Buddhism and Indonesia. The arrival of Islam that uses peaceful means tends to be more easily accepted by Indonesian people, by means of Islam that comes peacefully and does not impose its influence and culture, then slowly the development of Islam in Indonesia can develop rapidly, and another way that Islam uses is to alienate culture existing ones with teachings that are considered to be in accordance with Islamic law, so that unconsciously people are led to use Islamic methods through existing cultures, which is why later Indonesian cultures will emerge that are influenced by the existence of Islam in Indonesia, both in material and non-material forms. The Javanese war which erupted from 1825-1830 was one of the events that became the starting point of the beginning of colonialism in Java. The Javanese war became one of the major changes in the world in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. For the Javanese, especially in Surakarta and Yogyakarta, these periods were times that showed a decline in the Javanese order, especially in the palace. In addition, Dutch interference which was increasingly uncontrolled further worsened the situation. In Yogyakarta where Prince Diponegoro grew up to become a prince, this deterioration was increasingly apparent before the seconds of the Java War erupted. In the Java War, Prince Diponegoro served as one of the most important historical actors. Diponegoro who led the course of the Java War with his attitude and resistance to the colonial deserved high appreciation. In his resistance, Prince Diponegoro gained popular support as well as considerable involvement from the court which showed that Prince Diponegoro had considerable influence in the social life of society and the kingdom at that time. This rebellion was the first event of resistance faced by the Dutch Colonial Government which succeeded in changing the face of Java almost as a whole. The strategy and sacrifice given by Prince Diponegoro cannot be doubted. Although in the end the Prince Diponegoro succeeded in being defeated by the Dutch Colonial, this event had succeeded in fostering a spirit of unity and nationalism in the Javanese community. This research aims to analyze the form of innovation in historical learning at the secondary education level. This is in the background because of the decreasing interest of students in learning history subjects. The method used in this study is a qualitative research method that is a type of document study so that this study in other words is not done directly, but this research was conducted by looking for relevant sources in accordance with the current study. The results of this study are (1) we can find out whether what is actually the background of students to be reluctant to learn history, (2) we can find suitable learning models in order to encourage students to be interested in learning history, (3) we can know that from historical learning there will be a great contribution to foster a sense of nationalism for students as the next generation. Duplang site as a study of local history that teaches field learning or observation of the field. This is done so that in learning students can learn directly about the historic site. In its implementation it is done by observation and the results of the study consist of papers or the like with the intention of students to deepen the learning that he gets. In addition, students agree directly or indirectly to support and more than that to be able to preserve the cultural heritage. The teacher\\'s job is as a facilitator in implementing practices that discuss this local history. In learning local history can help with three forms namely classroom learning, direct observation and in-depth research. The students in this case obtain direct knowledge from the teacher about oral originating from the teacher obtained and then observe directly to be able to deepen and have a direct collection of the historical object. The use of information and communication technology in the context of history becomes a renewal with the teacher who utilizes interactive multimedia in the evaluation process can attract the attention of students and students who can take these historical values. The main purpose of learning local history is to take the values ​​intended for future life and to be able to attract the attention of students to be able to contribute in supporting and preserving the cultural heritage. On April 24, 1924 R.A.A Kromodjojo Adinegoro, one of the Regents of Mojokerto, collaborated with Ir. Henry Maclaine Pont, an architect of Balanda, founded Oudheidkundige Vereeniging Majapahit (OVM), an association aimed at examining Majapahit\\'s heritage. However, the OVM has undergone many name changes and has also moved a lot from the past to the present. Until now it is known as the PIM (Majapahit Information Center) which is protected by the BPCB JATIM (Cultural Heritage Conservation Center). Until now, the Majapahit Information Center (PIM) or often called the Trowulan Museum is currently located on Jl. Pendopo Agung, Dusun Unggahan, Trowulan Village, Kec. Trowulan, Kab. Mojokerto, East Java Province. This building is located on a land area of 54,935 mm. The museum consists of 3 main buildings namely buildings a, b, and c and small buildings.1) Building A, is a residential building located in the western part of the city. and is the main building of the museum until now. 2) Building B, a building built in 1926 is a semi-open building with wooden walls and a joglo shaped roof. The location of the building is to the east of building A, slightly protruding from the sea. 3) Building C, this building was founded in 1927 and was completed around 1928. The building is located to the east of building B. The shape of the building is quite interesting because the overall shape is similar to starfruit. TRIP stands for the Army of the Republic of Indonesia Student. The emergence of the East Java TRIP, which was originally an activity spearheaded by a group of students in the Surabaya area who had an interest in Indonesian independence and had a desire to fight for independence at that time. So that the students form a student struggle organization that is often known as TRIP, the organization was formed during the era of the independence war in 1946 in the Surabaya area. together with the formation of East Java TRIP Battalions in Mojokerto, Kediri, Besuki and Malang after the East Java Student Congress was held in the city of Malang in East Java, the result of the congress was the election of mas Isman as chairman or leader of the Student People\\'s Security Row in Surabaya Java Timur on October 25, 1945. (History, Republic, Student, Year, &amp; Suryadi, 2018).\\nAfter TRIP in East Java was formed in the Surabaya area on September 21, 1945, the student fighters formed a Battalion consisting of 5 Battalions including; Battalion 5000 at Malang Residency, 1000 Battalion in Jetis, Mojokerto area. 3000 Battalion at Kediri Residency, 4000 Battalion at Besuki Residency (Jember, Situbondo, Bondowoso, Banyuwangi) and 2000 Battalion at Madiun Residency. Looking at the events of fighting in order to maintain independence in East Java, the role of the influence of the East Java Jabung Temple is a historical heritage temple from Majapahit Kingdom in Probolinggo Regency, which is located in Jabung Candi Village, this temple heritage site is still not maximally used in history learning. this study aims to determine the value of education contained in the temple jabung so that it can help in class learning for students. This study is an analytical / descriptive study of the value of education contained in jabung temples. The research site is the jabung candi village in Paiton sub-district where the temple of jabung stands. The research method is by step 1. heuristics (data collection) through the stages of observation, document study, and interviews 2. Criticism of sources 3. Interpretation through qualitative descriptive and 4. Historiography. The study studied was the value of education contained in the temple in its use in historical learning. Candi Jabung was visited by Maha Raja Hayam Wuruk when traveling east of Java. The journey carried out by the king was followed by the leadership, minister, family and Maha Patih gajah Mada by leading the troops of the parade, the journey also aimed at seeing and uniting the territory of the Majapahit kingdom in the eastern Java region. When you get to Paiton, you can use it as a learning resource in the classroom and as a tangible proof of historical heritage around students. The conclusion is of course there is an educational value contained in this jabung temple in learning history. Traditions that run in society contain norms and values that become part of a group of nations and their supporters. The socialization activities were held for the sake of appreciation of the tradition by each of the supporting communities. One element of tradition in a culture is belief in the form of religion and symbols in it. Samin can be said to be a form of community that is still developing in Java, especially in East Java and Central Java. One of them is the Samin community which is still developing until now in the Japanese Hamlet, Margomulyo Village, Margomulyo District, Bojonegoro Regency. This study raised the existence of the tradition of the Samin Bojonegoro community in this modern era. This is expected to add insight to the readers\n",

A long journey is one of man\\'s biggest dreams. Break away from the comfort of life, explore the uncharted world, without a definite purpose and guarantee a safe return. This is what make decided them Bilbo, Gandalf, and thirteen Dwarves to meet Smaug, the giant dragon inhabiting the Silent Mountain. In this research, researchers used the Racmat Ddjoko Pradopo theory. Pradopo explained that structuralism is a structure with elements that are closer and every element that has meaning in relation to other elements. The researcher used the comparative method because the object under study was a comparative literary work. In analyzing the data, the researcher analyzed the quotes in the novel that were in accordance with the topic and also the theory used. This study aims to analyze the similarities and differences in intrinsic elements in the novels and scripts of the film The Hobbit. it can be seen that the intrinsic element plays an important role in building the story so that it is conveyed by the reader.Keywords: The Hobbit, Structuralism, Intrinsic Elements, Comparative Studies, Similarities and Differences. Of Mice and Men is a novel written by John Steinbeck, published in 1937. It tells about the story of George Milton and Lenny Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers, who move from place to lace in California in searching of a new job opportunities during the Great Depression in the United States. The novel is translated to Indonesian by Pramoedya Ananta Toer in “Tikus dan Manusia. So, it seems fun to analyse how the translator transfer meaning from source language to target language, especially in translating swearword which is found in the novel. The researcher used Hudges’s (1991) theory about swearword and Molina and Albir (2005), and Fawcet(1997) about translation techniques used by the translator. From the analysis, the researcher found 9 data of imbecile term for nuts, cuckoo, and ain’t bright, 23 data general terms for bastard and crazy, 39 data of death terms for the hell and goddamn, 6 data of mother in law terms for son of bitch, 1 data of racist for Nigger, 3 data of animal terms of rats, chicken, and cat, and 6 data of sexual irregulities for tart and bitch. It is also, 5 kinds of swearword translation techniques in the research, they are 9 data of literal translation, 1 data of particularization, 1 data of reduction, 3 data of transposition and 1 data of adaptation This research discusses the representation and discourse which focused on the elements of characterization and narration which is presented by mental disorder character in Silver Linings Playbook (2012), Touched with Fire (2015), and The Other Half (2016). In this research, mental illness is not analyzed as a medical narration but also is one of signifying practices. The approaches of media representation analysis from Simon Cross (2014) and Harper (2008) are used to determine the representation of life experiences and disassemble the emerging discourses. The result indicates that when mental illness is represented in the romantic film, the stereotype about abnormality, rejection, and exclusion still becomes the main structure of the narrative. The romance story that wraps it up still refers to the stereotype. Therefore, those three films can be concluded as a part of dominant statements on abnormality discourse against mental disorder sufferers. In this case, mental disorder sufferers are subjected as a subject that must change. It is because only one choice for mental disorder sufferers to be accepted in society, that is recovery.Keywords: Mental Disorder Character, Discourse, Representation, Film Every parent has high hopes for their children. They will protect their children from a bad environment to keep them from behaving badly too. This is also because their minds will be influenced by the environment in which they grow and develop. Because this research is based on literature, the researcher uses literary devices to support good and accurate research. Therefore, this paper uses qualitative research that provides description of the phenomena. For more technical analysis on the comparison of the data taken from the novel, this research uses comparative literature method. The results show that novel Harry Potter and The Order of Phoenix presents clearly the struggle of Harry and his friends to defeat Voldemort and his followers. Therefore, after the death of his parents, Harry was entrusted to a good family and an environment filled with people who really care about him. Imagination and ambition will be created on the basis of the thoughts of the doer. Therefore, the development of character in terms of ambition and imagination was found in the novel.Keywords: Literature, Children Character, Imagination, Ambition This study analyzes the representation of Black women struggle in Maya Angelou’s poem. In this study, the researcher chose a poems of Maya Angelou. The poem entitles “Equality”. In order to discover the representation of black women struggle in those poems, the study was conducted by using intrinsic elements of poetry, feminist literary critic, gynocriticism and biography of Maya Angelou. This study was conducted into two research problem; 1. How Maya Angelou represent black women struggle in her poem? 2. What kinds of struggle does Angelou describe in her poem? The result of this study shows that Maya Angelou represent the struggle of black women through the intrinsic elements. She represent that there is a clash between black women and white people. White people treat black women in a bad way because they are consider black women as slave. The poems shows that black women struggle against racism.Keywords: Representation, black women, struggle, gynocriticism Literature is a fiction in which the author has freedom in expressing their imagination. In viewing a film, the audience can represent the film according to what they see. This can be seen from the story line, moral massage, character, and so on. The character in a literary work elevates the aesthetic value, any character can be described by the author. It can be contained in a literary works, because it is an idea or imagination of someone to created an aesthetic purposes. The ugliness in the character it is called as grotesque. The grotesque character cause their alienation from his society, because the structured of body in ugly or odd. Researcher look for data relating to the question of the problem, how the of Cavern Concept in Beauty and The Beast. In this study, researcher used descriptive methods according to Suryana (2010:20) “metode yang digunakan untuk mencari unsur-unsur, ciri-ciri, sifat-sifat suatu fenomena. Metode ini dimulai dengan mengumpulkan data, menganalisis data dan menginterpretasikannya.” These conflicts to revealing the cavern concept includes: (1) condemnation of a Prince become an ugly figure. (2) transformation into to a Beast. (3) character’s emotional changes, because he as a Beast. (4) beast’s alienation from his environment or his world. Prepositional Phrase is the part of preposition and absolutely it is the part of grammar too. It has rules and deregulations that must be obeyed. Without a correct replacement of preposition, the meaning of the sentence can make the people confused. Hence, the research questions of this research are: 1) What are the positions of prepositions phrase of sentences found in Novel The Perfect Nany written by Leila Slimani?. 2) What are the patterns of tree diagram for a prepositional phrase of sentences found in Novel The Perfect Nany written by Leila Slimani?. The researcher use Position of Prepositional Phrase theory by Frank (1972) and theory of a tree diagram by Delahunty and Garvey (2010) to analyze the data. The findings show that the position of prepositional phrase in novel The Perfect Nany written by Leila Slimani is dominated by position in adverbial function (34 data). And the position in adjectival function is only found with 16 data. Base on the data analysis, it can be concluded that prepositional phrase adverbial function is more widely used than prepositional phrase adjectival function, because it can modify the verb, adverb, and adjectival that are mostly found in sentences. It is was also concluded that in one sentence there could be more than one prepositional phrase through the tree diagram that have been analyzed.Key words: Prepositional Phrase, Adverbial Function, Adjectival Function This research analyzes the elements of personality in the main character of Sweeney Todd: The Demon of Barber of Fleet Street by Tim Burton. The researcher uses descriptive qualitative methods because the results of this research are words which are then described. In this research, the reseacher found the elements of personality in the main character of Sweeney Todd: The Demon of Barber of Fleet Street by Tim Burton such as Todd id as the desire wants to revenge Turpin and Beadle because of what they did to Todd’s family, the desire wants to kill Pirelli because he knew his the real identity, and the desire wants to kill Mrs. Lovett because she lied him. The desires as Todd’s id realized and supported by the ego. The way how ego realized all of id in Sweeney Todd, the ego does his role with an action. Thus the superego does not appear much as the id. His role only related with a good value such as when Todd wants to reveal the fake barber about his crime.Keywords: Sweeney Todd, id, ego, superego. The present study sought to investigate how much independent second language learners acquire new language through movies. With the growing of Over-The Top (OTT) media services such as Netflix and Viu, which provide movies in many languages and from various nations, the possibility for public in general to watch any movies in any language is limitless, hence exposing them to acquire a new language. Two surveys, one about English and another about Korean acquisition, were conducted via Google Form and distributed via social media to examine how much informal L2 learners retrieve their stored input acquired from the movie viewing. Data collected were analyzed using mixed method data analysis. The result show that Korea movie viewers could recall more words than the English movie viewers. Korean movie viewers also seem to perform more on productive retrieval as they use the words they get from movies to communicate with their community. English movie viewers, on the other hand, seem to perform more on receptive retrieval as they can understand the story of the movies without needing subtitle. The findings suggest that watching movies greatly expose viewers to language input, which can be a great source of output when interacting within the movie-based community that they belong to.

      "42 This paper analyzes the evolution of economic history in the last 65 years. It argues that economic history has followed a path that goes from the strictly use of standard economics applied to economic past (i.e. cliometrics), to a general formal reflection of social history based on more flexible tools (i.e. cliodynamics). While cliometrics was a paradigm based on neoclassical theory and econometric methods, cliodynamics is a research agenda founded in non-neoclassical theoretical frameworks and quantitative methods not based on statistical inference. In that sense, the paper supports the idea that economic history has maintained its relevance in economics literature, despite the decay of particular traditions in the field. Schumpeter’s concept of creative destruction as the engine of capitalist development is well-known. However, that the destructive part of creative destruction is a social and economic cost and therefore biases our estimate of the impact of the innovation on GDP is hardly acknowledged, with the notable exception of Witt (1996). Admittedly, during the First and Second Industrial Revolutions the magnitude of the destructive component of innovation was no doubt small compared to the net value added to employment or GDP.However, we conjecture that recently the new technologies are often creating products which are close substitutes for the ones they replace whose value depreciates substantially in the process of destruction. Consequently, the contribution of recent innovations to GDP is likely upwardly biased. This note calls for further research in innovation economics in order to measure and decompose the effects of innovations into their creative and destructive portions in order to provide improved estimates of their contribution to GDP or to employment. The decade of 1930 was marked by the economic depression that affected with particular virulence the Pampas agricultural. In this context, the conservatives that intervened the government developed the National Agricultural Census in 1937. This work is an exploration of the productive structure of Entre Ríos and its forms of commercialization based on the use of the census as the main source. To this end, the sizes of the productive units of each of the departments, the majority of the productions and their distance to the rail ports and exit roads will be studied in depth. Finally, this information will be crossed with the commercial dynamics of the ports of Entre Ríos. In sum, this work will seek to obtain a detailed image of agricultural production with the aim of problematizing about the consequences of the 1930 crisis in this territory. This article presents a historical analysis of the development of trade and currency, in the&nbsp;period between the rise to power of Justinian (527-565) and its decline. The objective is to understand&nbsp;the reasons why this period was characterized by a significant increase in commercial&nbsp;flow, as opposed to the decline in trade that was generated mainly from the split of the&nbsp;Roman Empire in the fourth century of our era and in the capital event that meant the transfer&nbsp;of the Roman Empire to the city of Byzantium. Parallel to this historical development is the&nbsp;role of currency in the transition from pre-capitalist to capitalist economies, as a subsidiary&nbsp;element of commercial activity. The article’s objective is to analyze the performance of the Central Banks of three Latin&nbsp;American countries, verifying their operating policy and identifying the monetary models that&nbsp;have obtained the best economic performance between 2000 and 2014. A Vector Autoregressive&nbsp;Model was estimated in which the coefficients evidenced that for Brazil and Chile, the&nbsp;variables had a significant influence in the remaining variables of the economy. For Mexico,&nbsp;however, these variables were not significant.\\nThe financial innovations linked to globalization&nbsp;and trade liberalization have restricted the activities of regulating agents, promoting changes regarding the performance of the latter for the future.\\nThus, reduction of political and economic&nbsp;uncertainties, related to greater integration of countries in the international system, reflect&nbsp;changes in the strategies of central banks. The aim of this paper is manifold. In the first place, it proposes a population time series for&nbsp;Venezuela between 1783 and 2015, employing new estimates for the colonial period, the war&nbsp;of independence and information from the 2011 census. It also includes a first analysis of the&nbsp;demographic impact of immigrations for the population’s increase in the twentieth century.&nbsp;Moreover, a GDP series for the period 1783-1829 is presented. With the new population series&nbsp;and GDP, a historical series of the product and population from 1783 to 2014 is obtained. The objective of this paper is to describe and analyze the evolution of the tax collection and&nbsp;public expenditure of the Sovereign State of Cundinamarca between 1856 and 1885. In this&nbsp;period, political conflicts and the lack of legislative mechanisms to reach democratic agreements&nbsp;regarding the tax system affected the fiscal situation in Cundinamarca to a significant&nbsp;extent. Conflicts between liberals and conservatives for exercising control over local administration,&nbsp;and wars and the threat of new clashes were additional sources of political instability&nbsp;that affected local finances, affecting tax collection in some provinces and at the same time&nbsp;increasing military spending. One of the least developed fields in the economic historiography of Latin America and even&nbsp;less of Colombia is the field of biographical essays. This type of essays highlight the circumstances&nbsp;in which the most influent works of certain authors were conceived, the influences&nbsp;that permeated them and the intellectual and political motivations that propelled their ouvre.&nbsp;We have based this essay on an extensive interview conceded by Adolfo Meisel Roca, who is&nbsp;currently one of the most influent historians in Colombia, not only for having contributed to&nbsp;illuminate many of the least explored corners of economic history, but for his leadership and&nbsp;participation in social and economic studies in the forgotten regions of the country. This paper aims to interweave the history of the ports of Buenos Aires to the construction of Argentina as a nation, inserting itself in the capitalist globalization. Buenos Aires Urba-Port history reveals more than, how and where the loading / unloading process was carried out, can provide evidence of how the Capitalist Imperialism motivated the second Industrial Revolution to overcome the Great Depression at the center of the system, expanding the borders of capital. The engineer Huergo and the businessman Madero appear like great agents in that process, but other forces were the engines of the quantitative expansion of production, circulation, financing, population, etc., and the qualitative transformation of the port operation in Buenos Aires. Between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, different regions of Brazil underwent social, urban and economic transformations. These transformations were driven by, among others, an important service, means of transport and communication: The railroad. The railroads arrived in different locations, shortening distances, transporting people and goods. The central objective of this paper is to understand the arrival of the railroad in a municipality in the Brazilian interior: Varginha, located in the south of the State of Minas Gerais. With the use of handwritten fonts, printed sources and bibliographical references, it was possible to understand that the passage of the railroad through the municipality contributed to the urban and economic growth of Varginha. This paper deals with a diachronic and comparative study between two Atlantic cities: Salvador da Bahia, Brazil, and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, analysing their recent transformation. We study the evolution of both cities in relation to their respective ports and the concordance and differences existing in both processes. The comparative analysis addresses the geography of each city, as well as the origin and development of the port and urban areas. Although with logical differences, both spaces seem to have gone through similar processes of development, although the causes and results differ from case to case.\n",

      "44 Our surveys in the eastern part of Rough Cilicia led to the identification of numerous rural settlements. The survey area is bounded by the Kalykadnos (Göksu) and Lamos (Limonlu) rivers and lies between Erdemli and Silifke, districts of Mersin province.&nbsp; With its long coastline, Rough Cilicia not only forms part of the southern coastline of Anatolia but also is at an important position in the East Mediterranean.&nbsp; In the course of our surveys in the region numerous settlements of varying sizes and dating to various periods have been documented. Areas were visited and surveyed using total station and GPS and their topographic maps were drawn. Aerial photos were taken, as well. Evaluation and interpretation of data obtained from the surveys started to be made using different techniques. In this context, we initiated the interpretation of the spatial organization and settlement stages of agricultural activities in Rough Cilicia by employing geographical information systems and spatial-correlative analysis methods. Thus, we hope to derive scenarios regarding the spatial organization of agricultural activities in Antiquity based on common model(s) identified by transferring the archaeological finds to GIS and employing the spatial correlative analysis methods. Upon completion of this work we plan to reveal our model of the settlement staging that occurred between the urban and rural settlement areas in Antiquity by transferring to GIS the settlement network in Rough Cilicia. Studies brought to light new data regarding the geographic/climatic and social/political conditions that paved the way for the emergence of the rural settlements in this region. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of architecture and relevant production increasing toward the end of the 2nd century and into the 3rd century A.D. Most of settlements stand out with their well preserved remains. Remains recorded at settlements belong to a time span from the Hellenistic period through late antiquity. Settlements of Hellenistic character within the survey area are parts of a common defense and settlement system. Our recent surveys have noted a high number of Hellenistic settlements in the countryside in the survey region. These settlements remained inhabited after the Hellenistic period. Furthermore, many more settlements of rural character were also founded during and after the Roman period.\\n&nbsp; Archives or legal deposit organizations which are libraries, museums and archive organizations are memory organizations that offer services such as deposit, organizing, sorting, making ready for use and preserving physical documents that have archival quality in accordance with predetermined rules.\\nLegal Deposit is the name of compulsory the donation that, according to the royal charter (decree) or law, the printers, editors or authors are obliged to give one or more copies of each printed work to the State. The number of libraries benefiting from this business is many around the world. Compilation work in history begins with the decree of French King François I. The king issued a royal charter (decree) in Monpellier on 28 December 1537 in order to show the future generations that the fine arts and positive sciences were developed in his own age. In this edict, he ordered that no book could be put up for sale unless a copy was given to his private library in Blois castle. Other countries followed France’s deposit edict.\\nAn electronic transformation known as the digital revolution continues to occur in all areas of life. This transformation has affected the archives as well as in every organization providing public service. In Turkey, some of the cultural institutions have taken the cultural objects in their archives to the digital archive and made them available on the web. These are digitization of manuscripts, virtual museum implementation, audio-visual archive studies of TRT and contributions of some non-governmental organizations to the cultural inventory, etc. These studies are studies carried out by cultural institutions that are independent from each other, in line with their own initiatives, without a legal basis.\\nThe project of digital archiving of national cultural heritage materials and their access via a common web continues to expand. The name of the project is Turkey Cultural Inventory Project. It is accessible at &nbsp;www.envanter.gov.tr .\\nIn the introductory part of this article, how libraries, archives and museums that deposit archival materials started and their strategic developments throughout history will be briefly explained. With the communication age we are in, strategies for transition from physical storage to digital inventory will be explained with examples. After the legal deposit in the world will be explained briefly, the legal deposit works in Turkey will be summarized. In the last section, type the main topic of digital cultural inventory of Turkey, Turkey\\'s Culture Inventory database operation will be explained. In the seventh season of the excavations we have carried out in Knidos, excavations were carried out in important regions and structures of the city. During the 2018 excavations, drilling was carried out in the arrangement named \\\"Apsis 1\\\" in the western parados section of the Little Theater. In this study, which is very important in terms of the construction phases and techniques of the Little Theater, the basic level of the theater was reached and this level was revealed to the ceramics and other finds dating from the 3rd century BC to the 2nd century BC. Excavations have been continuing since 2016 in the area named East of Liman Street, another study area. In these studies, it was first used as a row of shops in the East of Liman Street in the Late Classical - Early Hellenistic Period, then the shop function was preserved again in the Roman Imperial Period, but the form and function of some spaces were changed and the last there is a complex used as a workshop / atelier and warehouse. During the 2018 excavations, three new additional rooms were found to the east of the first two rooms of the complex. Excavations have resulted in very good contexts regarding the abandonment of these three new sites, the complex and Knidos. Conservation and structural strengthening of historic masonry structures is a long and challenging process which necessitates technical expertise and constant budget to keep conservation works regularly. Thus, one of the priorities of cultural heritage management programs must focus on regional and site scale monitoring programs in order to evaluate structural and physical condition assessment of cultural assets, classify risk categories based on their damage levels and develop urgent and preventive precautions accordingly. This will keep historic structures in safe; and prevent severe destructions and loss of significant values by regular maintenance works within the technical and fiscal capacity of the institutions. Within the light of this information, the purpose of this paper is to discuss results of the architectural inventory methodology developed for Kanlıdivane Archaeological Site (Mersin) to provide a systematic condition assessment approach as a supportive assessment phase for decision-making process of comprehensive architectural conservation program to be developed in site scale. The ancient city of Diocaesarea located in the village of Uzuncaburç nearly 30 km north of Silifke in Mersin province. The objective of this study was to determine the character of the ancient city and to review the changes it underwent throughout different periods, as well as to learn its layout and plan. To achieve this, it was aimed to explore the settlements around the ancient city of Diocaesarea in order to derive results regarding the connection between the ancient city and its chora. The ancient city of Diocaesarea developed around the temple to Zeus Olbios and was the administrative and religious center of the region in the Hellenistic period attaining its monumental character in the Roman Imperial period. In the course of our surveys in the chora of Diocaesarea numerous settlements of varying sizes and dating to various periods have been documented. Most of them stand out with their well preserved remains. Remains recorded at settlements belong to a time span from the Hellenistic period through late antiquity. Settlements of Hellenistic character within the survey area are parts of a common defense and settlement system. The polygonal masonry observed on some structures of these rural settlements indicate that these settlements came into use in the Hellenistic period. These settlements remained inhabited after the Hellenistic period. Furthermore, many more settlements of rural character were also founded during and after the Roman period. With the Roman period a new settlement pattern arose in the region, and the Hellenistic settlements lost their defensive functions yet remained alive as rural settlements, which actually increased in number Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia Region, was at every period of its history the chief political and economic center of the region. The main reason for this situation is to be found in the fact that Tarsus has a large and fertile territory, and possesses a port on the Mediterranean coast, through which the Kydnos River passes. The fact that Tarsus is located at the point where the most important main road connecting Anatolia with the Eastern Mediterranean and Syrian geography enters the plain also made the city important and because of this road, it is also important in cultural and artistic terms for the inner regions of Anatolia in addition to its commercial, military or political importance. It has made it a city open to interaction with. It is possible to identify and trace the traces of this artistic interaction in rural settlements in the hinterland of Tarsus, rather than in the city centre, where archaeological research is difficult and limited due to the fact that it is a living city. Side streets that connect to the ancient main street, dated to Roman Period, and rural settlements located along these streets house monuments that represent this interaction. The main reason for the artistic and cultural interactions with Phrygia and Lycaonia and Kappadokia Regions from the early period is the heavy traffic of the Via Tauri, transporting not only people and goods in their culture. In rural areas, different cultures, lifestyles, habits, customs and traditions, and structures with different shapes reflected these were built. Village rooms should also be considered intangible cultural heritage values regarding their functional characteristics and implementation. These buildings, built with Folk Architecture characteristics, have started to disappear physically along with the original functions they have lost today. It has been determined within the scope of the \\\"Intangible Cultural Heritage of Isparta\\\" project supported by the Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Isparta Yalvaç District, Körküler Village, Süleyman Demirel University, where the examples of this building type exist. Necessary data were collected through multi-disciplinary field studies conducted. There is a typical architectural style in the buildings. As a result of the social value given to the building function and the different dynamics, the buildings have been highly preserved. The ancient city of Diocaesarea (Uzuncaburç) which is within the borders of the Eastern Rough Cilicia (Olba Region), draws attention with its Hellenistic, Roman and Late Antiquity ruins. Among these ruins, the theater is one of the few preserved examples in the city. The Monument can be dated precisely thanks to the inscription of scaenae. During the excavations conducted in 2017, several architectural blocks belonging to the scaenae of the theater, previously unknown, were unearthed. They present a rich picture with the architectural ornaments they carry, as well as gaining new data in the architecture of the especially Cilicia region and Asia Minor. In this study, the ionic cymation on a frieze piece obtained during excavations in the theater will be evaluated. Thanks to the “bead-and-reel” on the ionic cymation tongues, it appears as a unique ornament that has not been published before in Cilicia, Asia Minor and Syria. In this respect, it is understood that it differs from the ionic cymations used in buildings in other cities and a new style is used, and this is probably done by local workshops. In archaeology, the primary contribution of surveys to cultural heritage is that it provides an alternative to excavation. Thus, it ensures that the destruction of cultural heritage by excavation is avoided. This study first addresses the relationships between archaeology and cultural heritage. A description of archaeological information on the history of surveys are made. Furthermore, the\n",

Whether native English speaker teachers or non-native English speaker teachers who are more appropriate to teach English in outer or expanding circle countries have been discussed and researched by some scholars. This paper discusses about peopleâ€™s preference towards both of them by investigating previous research about peopleâ€™s perception towards native English speaker teachers and non-native English speaker teachers. This paper also explores another issue arising from the dichotomy of native and non-native i.e. Whose English and what English should be taught in Indonesia. Whether English Native or other varieties of English is best taught in Indonesia.Keywords : Native English Teachers, Non-Native English Teachers, World Englishes This study aimed to describe in depth between the link of school policy and the school quality improvement. The method in this study is a qualitative method using the case study presented descriptively. This research was conducted at SMA Negeri 2 Babat Tomat Kabupaten Musi Banyuasin. Based on this study it was found that the First, free school policy can help the economy / ease the burden of school costs to be incurred by the parents. Second, the policy constraints of the application for free school educa-tion at SMAN 2 Babat Toman is not very effective, so that the students\\' interest is not increasing, infrastructure is one of the obstacles in the implementation of free school education, how the quality of schools will be increased if it is not supported by facilities and complete infrastructure. Third, the quality of school education free SMAN 2 Babat Toman already realized well with regard to input, input turns unselected maximum, that is the students. Fourth, the implementation of free school education in Banyuasin, the quality of school SMAN 2 Babat Toman Muba Sumsel was not increased. This means that the implementation for free school education quality of school SMAN 2 Babat Toman was not increased.Keywords : free schools, school quality, case studies \\\"Men sana in corpore sano\\\", strong soul stays within a healthy body. This slogan is firmly attached inside the mindset of the parents who constantly strive to run a healthy lifestyle by eating healthy foods. But now, in the era of modern and fast-paced, food technology developments offer a great selection of processed food products that are attractive and fast to the public without considering the nutrients needed by the human body. In fact, the number of food product advertisement serve the interesting and am-biguous packaging information which impact on consumption patterns that are not based on awareness of eating. Awareness of eating can be formed by the knowledge of the characteristics of all types of daily food. Food chemistry education is one of the right ways to complement public knowledge about the characteristics of all types of daily food, especially about the best nutrients of food needed to maintain his physical and mental health. Finally, when the awareness of healthy foods eating that has been formed and embedded in society as a whole, then it would have a positive impact on the development of a healthy and strong Nation.Keywords : food chemistry education, awareness of eating This research is motivated by the lack of interest of teachers in the use of props in the process of learning mathematics in elementary school. In accordance with the demands of the curriculum in 2013 and supported by the developed learning theory, learning mathematics is abstract object of study, students need an intermediary that props math-ematics, so that students can more easily understand the concepts that will be pre-sented, and in the end it can deliver students to solve mathematical problems, not only that proposed by the teacher but also the problems in life. The purpose of this study was to determine the interest of prospective elementary teachers on the use of props mathematics after getting lectures media and elementary mathematics learning model. By knowing the interest of prospective elementary teachers will be developed further realization of the state of the subject being studied. The method used is descriptive research, then the instruments used were questionnaires and interviews. The results of this study stated that the interest of prospective elementary teachers on the use of props after attending lectures media and elementary mathematics learning model is high over-all with a percentage of 76.70%.Keywords : Interest, Props Mathematics Oneâ€™s ability to absorb and master the subject matter is different from one another. Some are able to learn quickly, some other are slow. This may be caused by the learning styles and also some aspects both from within and from outside. The purpose of this study was to find out what learning styles adopted by the students of STKIP Purnama, especially those who already work in both at school and in other institutions and also to identify the factors that influence the studentsâ€™ learning activities. This research method applied were observation, interview, and documentation. The results showed that learning style that is applied by students STKIP Purnama, especially those who already work, is the auditory and visual learning styles. A total of 15 respondents applying auditory learning style, while 5 respondents applying visual learning style.Keywords : learning materials, learning style Understanding the local heritage wisdom of Indonesia and biodiversity through the environmental education is a first step in conservation. This paper is based on a litera-ture review of scientific papers that have been published in books and scientific journals. The environmental education is an educational process that aims to create a community to have concern for the environment and matters related thereto. Formal education in schools is considered to be one of the effective ways to promote the conservation of biodiversity. Providing the material of the concept knowledge/ heritage wisdom and the concept of biodiversity in the formal curriculum in schools is expected to increase the awareness of the environment to preserve biodiversity. Biodiversity includes the diversity of habitats, species diversity, and genetic diversity.

This paper highlights the effect of ASEAN-Korea Free Trade Agreement (AKFTA) on Indonesian export of manufacturing products since AKFTA as one of the significant initiatives in Southeast Asia is expected to boost Indonesian export. By using augmented gravity models with panel data, this paper investigates the presence of trade creation and trade diversion effects on Indonesian export with 20 trading partners, covering a 26-year period from 1990-2015. Fixed effects with least square dummy variable (LSDV) models are applied to tackle the endogeneity problems of FTA by controlling the unobserved heterogeneity. The results showed that trade diversion outweighs trade creation effects in almost all categories, confirming a decrease in export from member to non-member countries.DOI: 10.15408/etk.v17i2.7342 The purpose of this paper is to theoretically address a surprising omission in literature by proposing a cognitive mechanism that sanctions individual-level unethical behaviors. This secondary literature-based qualitative study fills a theoretical gap by employing an extensive review of substantive empirical and theoretical literature of the last 15 years. However, those who consider their moral identity necessary for their self-concept are less likely to behave unethically. This proposed process, along with the path suggested by previous studies, in which individuals are having job autonomy feel unconstrained by rules before engaging in unethical behaviors. So, it proposes an underlying cognitive mechanism between job autonomy and unethical behavior. This study implies that it clarifies job autonomy’s role in promoting the negative outcome of employees’ unethical behaviors and informs organizational policymakers about the importance of satisfying the need for job autonomy.JEL Classification: D23, M12, M51, O15How to Cite:Ahmed, A., Shamsi, A.

It is important for us to understand the relation among them in order to prepare Indonesian companies for ASEAN Economic Community in 2015. The study examines the effect of financial reporting quality on financing and investment of 15 Indonesian companies with large market capitalization based on the Standard and Poor’s Rating Services in its first survey of the major corporate credit trends in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Those companies may still be under-investing in relation to its regional peers. The results suggest that (1) financial reporting quality has negative effect on financing. (2) financial reporting quality has positive effect on investment among companies with higher likelihood of over-investing and negative effect on investment among those with higher likelihood of under-investing.DOI: 10.15408/etk.v16i1.4600\n",
      "48 This article argues that critical Romani studies should examine the EU’s top-down policies of Roma integration as an exercise in federalism, since the EU’s quasi-federalist structure both accommodated and co-opted the fight for Roma rights. To bolster its analysis, this article draws comparisons to the actions of the United States (“U.S.”) federal government during Civil Rights. Of course, both Roma integration and Civil Rights are still inchoate projects. However, the longer arc with which scholars have assessed Civil Rights, including its periods of progress and retrenchment, can help develop a framework for predicting how Romani rights within the EU’s federalist system might fare during similar cycles. Three lessons flow from the comparison. First, integration policies spurred by the top rung of the federalist architecture can foment a populist backlash, especially if disparities in competence or enforcement prompt deficits in legitimacy. Second, governmental efforts are necessary for integration but not sufficient; they must work in tandem with advocacy at the grass-roots level. Finally, pushing federalism “all the way down” to incentivize local experimentation with Roma policies might counteract obstructionism to Roma integration at the national level, but this is not a panacea. Local experimentation might take the form of self-governing districts and economic set-asides, but they can just as easily permit local institutions to perpetuate exclusion and marginalization. This paper analyzes to what degree and how educational&nbsp;research from a European context explains Roma disadvantage in education by referring to nomadism. Three thematic areas emerged from an analysis of 55 research papers. First, that Roma are closely associated with nomadism in the literature, creating an essentialist discourse. Second, that anti-nomadism contributes to&nbsp;explaining and justifying Roma exclusion. Third, that this impacts how the relationship between Roma and education is uderstood.&nbsp;Nomadism is seen as both incompatible with and in opposition to education, and nomadic learning is seen as a distinct learning&nbsp;style. All in all, the analysis shows that knowledge production on Roma and education has established a discourse where it is&nbsp;legitimate to use nomadism to explain Roma disadvantage ineducation. This understanding builds on an essentialist view&nbsp;of Romani culture, and it elaborates and sustains key tropes of&nbsp;antigypsyist discourses. Scholars have long been interested in researching Roma; a form&nbsp;of “top-down research,” where the&nbsp; researcher analyzes, gathers&nbsp;data, and interviews the “objects” of the research, is still dominant&nbsp;in the field, although an increasing number of critics have been&nbsp;proposing ways of including Roma in knowledge production&nbsp;to shape the discourse about themselves. Exclusion of Roma in the process of research silences their voices and contributes to&nbsp;incomplete, flawed findings that often reinforce stereotypes. This&nbsp;paper takes a critical look at interactions and the power dynamics&nbsp;between the researcher and the informant(s) during research&nbsp;based on one in-depth case study: fieldwork conducted in a small town in Hungary in 2012–13. The presented research is one&nbsp;small step towards deconstructing knowledge production with&nbsp;a focus on research ethics and practice, rather than a large-scale&nbsp;paradigm change. This paper strives to transcend the scholarly&nbsp;field of Romani Studies specifically, and contribute to the broader&nbsp;literature on Social Science methodology, especially scholarship&nbsp;about interpretive methods and fieldwork. This article presents a critical discourse analysis of the European Union’s documents released between 2008 and 2016 on the Right to Housing and on the inclusion of the Romani minority. The objective is to analyze the definition of adequate housing and its impact on the representation of the Roma and on the consequent housing strategies. The article highlights how a restrictive interpretation of the term “adequate housing”, understood exclusively as a series of physical parameters, associates the Roma with “inadequate” and “substandard” accommodation. This interpretation supports the persistent representation of the Roma as a vulnerable homogeneous group, “Other” from “mainstream society”, informing paternalistic policies that prevent the meaningful participation of Romani individuals in decisionmaking. Furthermore, it fails to acknowledge the immaterial factors affecting the subjective understanding of the house and its relation with the identity of the individual, hindering the empowering potential of home-making practices. Following this analysis, the article claims the necessity of recognizing the impact of affective and immaterial factors such as the creation of a socially supportive environment and the possibility of personalizing the domestic space, in the development of housing policies aimed at supporting the identity and well-being of the individual. As a social phenomenon and an ideology, anti-gypsyism is sustained on essentialized narratives, which reify ethnic borders (between those considered as Roma and non-Roma) and assumes internal homogeneity of all members of the Romani group based on vaguely-defined and generalized notions of “culture” or “ethnicity”. These narratives tend to exclude plural and diverse representation of social realities and intersecting Romani identities, which can challenge the dominant and stigmatizing discourse. In this paper, I analyse how academic discourse contributes to sustaining essentialist representations of Roma and assess how more nuanced, plural, and context-sensitive interpretations of ethnic identity can contribute to challenging anti-gypsyism. By reviewing the scholarship of Brubaker (2002, 2004), Hall (1996) and Vertovec (2007), I discuss the potential of definitions in deconstructing homogenized and essentialized discourses on Roma in knowledge production and beyond. Furthermore, I discuss how the emergence and dynamic development of Romani scholarship has been gradually challenging the legacy of Romani Studies and providing an entry into new avenues of research, conducted primarily from the standpoint of Romani scholars. I argue that their engagement in knowledgeproduction is essential for promoting diversified, balanced and context-sensitive discourses. In this article, rather than prescribing a specific, normative framework for Romani Studies and elaborating a fixed research agenda, I point to possible directions and promising theoretical avenues which may provide a refreshing counter-balance to an otherwise homogenizing scholarship. In doing so, I assess possible implications for adapting diverse notions of ethnicity as a tool for de-essentializing academic discourses on Roma – including advantages and existing risks. Such an approach enables the mapping out of issues and challenges relevant for the process of elaborating a Critical Romani Studies research agenda. This paper explores neoliberal discourse as a racial discourse&nbsp;in relation to how Roma are conceived by academics and&nbsp;policymakers. I develop the concept of the class-to-race cascade as&nbsp;a way to describe the phenomenon, whereby the marginalization&nbsp;of racialized minorities is attributed entirely to their classposition. The cascade flows as follows: neoliberal policies&nbsp;slash benefits to low-income people, low-income people are&nbsp;disproportionately racially marginalized, thus neoliberal policies&nbsp;affect different racialized minorities, perpetuating racism. I trace&nbsp;the lineage of the class-to-race cascade to the concept of the“underclass” as it was developed in the U.S. particularly through&nbsp;the work of William Julius Wilson after the neoliberal turn. I&nbsp;then critique the work of Iván Szelényi and János Ladányi who&nbsp;adapted the “underclass” thesis to Roma, using the class-to-race&nbsp;cascade. Finally, I apply the concept to urban policy discourse inBudapest’s Eighth District, where a large Roma community has&nbsp;lived for nearly a century. I show in this paper that the class-torace cascade is a prominent discursive feature of both policy and&nbsp;academic concepts of Roma. Christian missionaries played a major role in the process of Othering Sinti and Roma. This “Other” was – like the colonial subject – mainly viewed as primitive, uncivilized, superstitious, and heathen. From the early nineteenth century, Protestant missions were established in Germany to “civilize” and educate Sinti and Roma. This paper takes a critical stance on these Protestant missionary efforts in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, highlighting the relevance of postcolonial studies for Romani studies. Firstly, I outline interconnections between stereotypes related to Zigeuner in the colonial metropole and “primitives” in the peripheral areas, which is then followed by an analysis of Protestant views on these two subordinate groups and the ways in which knowledge was transferred between Protestant missionaries across time and space. Finally, this analysis is followed by a methodological reflection on the benefits and limitations of postcolonial studies for critical Romani studies. In this article I explore linkages between the evolution of African-American filmic representation and the patterns of Romani representation in films from Central and Southeast Europe (CSEE). More specifically, I use the 1970s Blaxploitation movement and subsequent shift of African-American representation into films reliant on a realist aesthetic to contextualize analysis of the shortcomings of the Civil Rights Movement to provide broad integration for African-Americans. Given other similarities between the racialized positionalities of African-Americans and Roma, I argue that Blaxploitation can illuminate trends in the cinematic depictions of CSEE Roma, since the Roma Rights movement has had to contend with similar shortcomings in achieving political, social, and economic inclusion. The films I analyze in this piece include Roming (2007), Just the Wind (2012), Episode of an Iron Picker (2013), and Bravo! (2015). Drawing on theories of identity postulated by cultural theorists, scholars of gender identity, and critical race theorists, I explore issues of identity politics and “Otherness” as they pertain to Romani identity, history and activism. By critiquing the latent bifurcation of identity and subjectivity in Judith Butler’s theory of performativity as well as her explicit adherence to universalism, I begin to outline a (post-Hegelian) hermeneutic in which narratives of self enable political processes of self-determination against symbolic and epistemic systems of racialization and minoritization.[1] Roma identity both serves as an oppressive social category while at the same time empowering people for whom a shared ethnic group provides a sense of solidarity and community. In re-conceptualizing, reimagining and re-claiming Romani-ness, we can make movements towards outlining a new Romani subjectivity – a subjectivity that is firmly rooted in counterhistories of Roma, with porous boundaries that both celebrate our diversity and foster solidarity. I come to the subject of Romani identity from an understanding that our racialized and gendered identities are both performed and embodied – forming part of the horizon from which we make meaning of the world. I wish to recast the discourse surrounding Romani identity as hybridized and multicultural, as well as, following Glissant, embedded into a pluritopic notion of history. Despite the vast research on Roma in Europe and beyond,&nbsp;little has been written about Roma agency from a perspective&nbsp;that focuses on manifold dynamics of power. Having worked&nbsp;for two years on the Finnish Roma Inclusion Project in a dual&nbsp;role as ethnographer and project worker has inspired me to rethink&nbsp;concepts of power and to create an alternative narrative of the&nbsp;experience of marginalized and discriminated Finnish Kaale&nbsp;Roma. Encouraged by the current paradigm shift in Romani&nbsp;Studies (which increasingly focuses on Roma agency instead of&nbsp;objectifying the population), this paper explores Kaale power&nbsp;dynamics as part of the social order and empirically demonstrates&nbsp;two parallel and antagonist systems of power exercised by Roma:&nbsp;one that stems from the population’s traditional cultural customs&nbsp;and the other from Pentecostal/charismatic Christianity, agrowing trend among the Finnish Kaale. The purpose of this&nbsp;article is to underline Roma agency within the frame of national&nbsp;Roma policy practices in Finland. In his 2016 book Notes on the Ontology of Design, Arturo Escobar asks whether it is possible to talk about the existence of a “critical design theory”. He states that if by “critical” we mean the application of a series of critical theories and approaches in the fields of design, and a certain connection to cultural studies, then we can talk about the ongoing development of a “critical design theory”. Based on an analysis of a set of objects by the social enterprise Meșteshukar ButiQ (Bucharest, Romania), I analyze the role of design in the construction and representation of Romani identity. Generally, design is interpreted as a representation of the self, however it has a significant role in constructing it too. According to Penny Sparke, “design is seen as being part of the dynamic process through which culture is actually constructed, not merely reflected” (2013: 4). Through an analysis of the products created and sold by Meșteshukar ButiQ and its collaborators, I examine the role of design not just in expressing but also in creating meanings, and thereby, I emphasize the design process’ importance in identity politics.\n",
      "49 This comment of jurisprudence analyzes the origin of the applicability of estoppel in labor matters, particularly in relation to the case of a worker who demanded as part of the basis for calculating the compensation for termination of the contract, the \\\"gratification\\\" the employer paid the worker informally, and for which the latter signed a public document, noting that it was a contribution given in a \\\"voluntary and liberally way.\\\" From this case, the author analyzes whether is posible to completely rule out the application of estoppel in labor matters, taking into consideration that this theory is founded on good faith rather than autonomy. The article analyzes, from the horizontal efficacy of the fundamental rights, possible limits to the employment power in labor relationships. Firstly, identifies characteristics of the employment relationship, especially material inequality between parties, and existing legal hierarchy. It then appreciates the principle of material equality as protective measure against the exacerbation of the exercise of employment power. Finally, he affirms the attachment of individuals to fundamental rights, and points to examples of labor reform, especially the prevalence of negotiated over the legislated, as a potential injury to fundamental social rights, and concludes by the prevalence of fundamental rights in labor relations, guaranteeing material equality. between the subjects. The methodology is analytical-interpretative of bibliographical and documentary research, organized by the inductive method. This article gives an overview about the so-called multiperiodality of the working day, which is notably extended in the Italian and European law. On the other hand, it will examine the regulation of the working day in Peru, taking into consideration its historical background, definitions in the literature, as well as its reception in the Constitution. The aim is to show the difference between the regulation of the above mentioned legal institution and its application in reality. Here will be proposed to apply the multiperiodality of the working day in Peru, where it might be appropriate in dealing with the problem of labour informality. This paper’s main objective is to answer the question of whether it is necessary for the effectiveness of trade union immunity of Article 221 of the Labor Code -established for workers who form a base union-, that the union leadership informs of the constituent assembly to the company in which the constituents employees work at, as provided in Article 225 of the Code. This purpose requires determining the correct meaning and scope of both Article 221 paragraphs 3 and 4, and Article 225 paragraphs 1 and 3 °, both of the Labor Code, and the linkage between these legal precepts. This is to determine the legal nature of the communication of holding the constituent assembly of a union to the employer, and what are the consequences that derive from it, as well as its omission or faulty communication. This article denies that the current recourse of unification of jurisprudence must be understood as a mechanism that incorporates to the Chilean legislation the judicial precedent, as being contrary to the proper postulates of a traditional rule of law state. lts reason rests on a dogmatic-politic premise, that is, the content of the constitutional provisions must be set by rules, made by political deliberation, and not left to an elite group as it is the Supreme Court, at the cost of appropriating a strictly political discussion. This appropriation, combined with a mechanism of binding precedent, would let the judge in a situation comparable to that of the legislature. This article pretends to show some cases where it is doubtful the application of the Labor Code to resolve a particular dispute, especially in the case of termination of the bond between ofﬁ cials of the Primary Health, been those individuals subject a municipal corporation governed by Law Nº 19.378 and additionally by Law Nº 18.883. The irregular overuse of contract fees at the state administration, is a phenomenon that has become commonly used to fulfill government functions. This mechanism, established in our legal system, only to accidental or specific tasks, is used at various levels of government, under regimes of subordination or dependence, which threatens the observance of the Labour Public Order and the recognition of consecrated labor rights for all citizens. The text analizes the socio-cultural transformations of the last centuries, especially observing the technological evolution in the labor relations scenario. It points out the issues in the transposition from Modernity to the Post-Modernity and analyzes the Brazilian labor framework normative (modern) comparing it to the globalized work, digital and «flexisseguro» (postmodern). It also goes through the concepts and uses of systematic legal interpretation opposed to the systemic method in which it stands. It concludes that (i) Brazilian Labor Law lacks of reality it intents do rule, which can be reached by the interpretative path, since the operator handles the right tools of the systemic method, (ii) and such deliberation is necessary to the sustainability and administration of the specialized branch of the labor law, because the distance of reality, even being dynamic and complex, makes it meaningless. The author discusses the current challenges being experienced by the social security system. To this end, he reviews the historical background of social security, its current configuration, and the ILO instruments that guide the national social security systems. It ends with a proposed solution to the situations involving the five main branches of the social security system, i.e., Health, Pensions, Professional Risk Protection, unemployment Protection and Family benefits Duque v. Colombia, which was brought before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, concerns the refusal to recognize the right of a homosexual person to a survivor´s pension. At the time, Colombian law did not give same-sex couple this right. The claimant –Angel Alberto Duque– filed a writ for protection of his constitutional rights to obtain the pension. The ruling and appeal held that the writ was not the appropriate form to use in a pension request and that the defendant should follow regular judicial procedures. The Colombian Constitutional Court subsequently did not review the case. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights brought the case before the Inter-American Court after Colombia had failed to comply with the Commission´s recommendations of 2014. The Inter-American Court declared that Colombia, in having denied the survivor´s pension to Duque since 2002, had violated his right to equality and non-discrimination provided by the American Convention on Human Rights. The Court stated that Colombia had provided access to survivor´s pensions only to heterosexual couples and had failed to provide an “objective and reasonable justification” for the differential treatment. The Court ordered that the State ensure that Duque receive priority processing for his survivor´s pension application This work deals with the nature of the security duty in labor relations from their constitutional and legal sources, determining its nature and scope.\n",
      "50 Severe spermatic damage in infertile man can be the result of presence of deletion in chromosome Y and in AFZc region (Zoosperm factor Zone C). This study was made in 97 men with infertility and a frequency of 6% to the presence of deletion in the studied population. Of those men positive to deletion in Zone Yq (AZFc) were born three children by using intracytoplasmatic injection (ICSI), whom inherited mutation in chromosome Y, it established the importance to create a sifting program to detect the presence of deletion in this chromosome infertile men population, candidates to Assisted Reproduction Technique treatments (ART) by ICSI. The following study evaluated the association between Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT) and Neisseriae Gonorrhoeae (NG) using COBAS AMPLICOR CT/NG MOLECULAR SYSTEM technique in 35 women urine samples with a 23.9 year old average. 20 samples were positive to CT, showing a prevalence of 5.63%. Although, epidemiological studies have reported a relationship between Chlamydia Trachomatis infection and the ones caused by others microorganisms like Neisseriae Gonorrhoeae; this study didn’t find any association. Factors like kind of sample and the presence of inhibitors in urine, diminished sensibility to detect Neisseriae Gonorrhoeae. The following study set up an enzymatic immune test (ELISA) using viral particles broke up of field strain of IBR virus; it showed a high sensibility and specificity and low rate of false negatives and positives. Positive and negative bovine serum which ELISA technique was normalized, were analyzed by seroneutralization to determine anti IBR antibodies; It was collected positive and negative serum with titles 1:4 to 1:128 and was considered dilution of bovine serum 1:50 as optimal dilution to ELISA technique.On the other hand, coefficient of variation BR was used to analyze the rehearsing of absorbance obtained by positive and negative serum. The results obtained were less than 20%, which indicated an appropriate trustiness and a low coefficient of variation. Sensibility and specificity found was 96% and 98% respectively, taking as a reference test the seroneutralization. The results obtained determined that ELISA test with viral particles broke up of field strain detected anti IBR antibodies with a high sensibility and specificity, being an improvement tool to diagnose the illness. At present one of the most important environmental problems is contamination of soil ecosystem by hydrocarbon spilling mainly of oil and its derivates which occurs when oil is explored or transported. Furthermore in Colombia it occurs due to violent assaults made by men outside of law against petroleum infrastructure.To solve this problem there are treatment methods to recover contaminated soil as Landfarming technique, adding inorganic nutrients. In this research this technique was evaluated in vitro, through a design of six experimental units (EU) which contained contaminated soil with crude oil; three EU were treated with Triple 15 inorganic fertilizer and the other three were taken as biotical control. Landfarming effectiveness was determined by pH analysis, humidity percent, temperature, count of total heterotrophic microorganisms, and probable number of oil degrades microorganisms, nutrients and total hydrocarbons for a four month experimental period. At the end of that period, in Landfarming treatment with nutrients added was achieved a high remotion percentage of TPH up to 91%, getting final TPH concentration of 2028ppm comparing biotic control in which the remotion percentage achieved up to 65% and a TPH final concentration was 8049ppm thus, it could demonstrate that nutrient addition optimizes the degrading hydrocarbon process in soil. This work shows an isolation and evaluation model of microorganisms deterioration agents of documental heritage. 28 Isolations were recovered and identified as conservation with biodeterioration as in deposit No. 15 atmosphere of AGN (Bogotá-Colombia). Of this group, 16 microbial isolations showed hydrolytic capability on vegetable fibers when they were cultivated in with cellular walls at 1% as the unique carbon source. In the recovered microbial populations were evaluated the capability to hydrolyze cellulose, xylane, almidon and protein. Taking into account degradation haloes and the number of hydrolyzed substrates were selected four isolations: two of Penicillium sp., one of Bacillus sp. and one of Actinopolyspora sp..Polymerase activities and accessories were quantified on them and it was determined Isoenzymatic profile to cellulase and xilanase. The results suggest: filamentous fungi and Actinomycete are more efficient degradation complex polymer (cellulose), probably the bacterial population acts as a secondary settler and Isoenzymatic profile permits discard saprophyte microorganisms, specialized in degrading cellulolytic support. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the actual condition of Academics rotation in Bacteriology and Clinical Laboratory Program in Colegio Mayor de Cundinamarca University (CMCU) according to the criteria established by Accreditation National Council (ANC) to health programs which are constituted as one of the challenges to form integral professionals, through rotation settings defined as settings where all kind of students in health area can develop learning activities and also to offer service. These places can be hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical laboratories, animal research centres, health insurance companies and industries which must carry out with all requirements established to make agreements with them. In educational scope, institutions must guarantee quality and efficiency of all professionals that work there. In this way is necessary to talk about evaluation not only in academic programs, learning Institutions and students but also in Practice Settings. Without doubt, the vaccines are the most viable and effective alternative for the control of the contagious infected diseases, however, a successful strategy for the vaccines design must have in consideration many of the aspects of exempt response in a heterogeneous population and in your form of recognizing and presenting the antigens of the patogens. Therefore, not only the accurate understanding of the exempt mechanisms involved in the resistance to infections but the identification of the molecules of the patogen that they are protective response target, they will be central motive of the investigation in vaccines in the immediate future. The present review article deepens in the discovery, location, expression, structure, inheritance, polymorphism and importance of major complex hispocompatibility, and presents the advances in the use of primates as model for the vaccines development. Biofilm is a cell population which grows up together in a wrapped surface in a exopolysaccharide matrix which protects them of antibiotic attacks. More than 60% of all microbial infection is caused by Biofilm, to raise the resistance of these antimicrobial communities there are several mechanisms among others; antibiotic inactivity by extracellular polymerous or enzymatic alteration, grow rate diminished due to nutrient limitation, phenotypic changes in bacterial cells as a result of acquisition of resistance gene into biofilm and the persistence of a small cell group in bacterial community.The prognostic to treat and quit out biofilms is not encouraging in the immediate future. Is necessary and urgent to develop new medicines to counteract infectious on which biofilm is involved. Biofilm infection is evident with symptoms that clinically revert to antibiotic treatment. American Health Institute issued: “more than 60% of all microbian infectious are caused by biofilms”, also a 60% is attributed to them in nosocomial infections, increasing in this way hospitable stay, attention fees and mortality; due to its large resistance to antimicrobial a thousand times more than cells which live in planktonic way. The objective of the current revision is to illustrate about biofilm formation and its role in the infectious process. The control of medications, waters and biological products ace to function of State one eats making in continuous form from 1919 when the Congress of Colombia creó the Bacteriological and Chemical Laboratory, like to dependence of the National Direction of Hygiene calling it “Official Laboratory of Hygiene.” This function of Surveillance and Control is more efficient when in 1947, the government buys the Laboratory “Samper Martínez” to his founders who carried out these controls to his biological products that elaborated in that laboratory. A recount is made the Ministry of Health that has had several names then already in 1920 called himself later Ministry working Hygiene and Social Prevention and 80 years of how it is denominated Ministry of the Social Protection. This Ministry has always worried to exercise the surveillance and control to the medications and allowances, activity that has executed in dispersed form to inclination several institutions what took to consider the creation of an institution of national order that had these functions and it exercised them with more effectiveness. It was born this way the National Institute of Surveillance of Medications and Allowances (INVIMA) created by the Law 100 of December 23 1993 and it began to exercise their functions starting from February of 1995. Ten years after their creation the Government has manifested his intentions of passing his functions to the National Superintendence of Health. Lastly it is questioned if the Government’s attitude is due to a weakness in the operation of this institution or to that has not completed with the functions that were assigned him. Situation that he/she would go in the detriment of the insurance of the quality of the medications and allowances, as fundamental elements in the well-being and the consumer’s health. In order to find the behavior of the Astrovirus isolates from diarrheic samples taken from children under 5 in four different cities of Colombian, there were tested 1147 samples between 1996 and 2002. The diagnosis of HastV was done by EIA and there were found 2,8% of global prevalence. Fourteen of the positive samples were typed by RT PCR and sequencing the 384bp region of the ORF2 segment of the viral genome (which codes for the capsid protein). Neighbor joining was done in order to make the phylogenetic study. The conclusions of the study were that in Colombia, HastV has an endemic behavior and the Colombian strains, obtained from samples of geographically distant or the same places, show that there is no genetic variability among the same genotype and among strains with the same typed but collected out of this country. The present study evaluated the recovery in vitro of S. mutans ATCC 25175 in seven culture of media: Mitis Salivarius Agar (MSA), Mitis Salivarius Agar-Bacitracin (MSB), Mitis Salivarius Agar-Kanamycin- Bacitracin (MSKB), Mitis Salivarius Agar-Bacitracin-Sulfisoxazole (MS-MUT), Trypticase soy-Extract of yeast-Sucrose-Bacitracin Agar (TYS20B) (media indexed as selective), Infusion Brain Heart Agar (BHI) (enriched medium) y Todd Hewitt Agar (TH) (selective medium for Streptococcus). A bigger recovery of the microorganism was demonstrated in the medium TYS20B, continued in decrease order: BHI, MSA, TH, MS-MUT, MSB and MSKB. The medium TYS20B was the most appropriate for the microorganism; presenting a percentage of significantly more recovery to the other evaluated selective media, coinciding with the other studies in the world for recovery the S.mutans.\n",
      "51 Recent globalization in business environment requires accounting education to shift its curriculum from supply driven approach to demand driven approach due to the need of high skill workers by the industry. Thus, this study aims to explore the professional skills needed to prepare graduates to be successful in the working environment based on employers and final year accounting students perspectives. Professional skills in this study consist of technical skills (accounting, finance, tax), management skills, information technology skills, intellectual skills, interpersonal skills and personal skills. This quantitative study utilized questionnaire to collect data from 150 final year accounting students and 50 employers from accounting firms. Findings show that accounting students rated that intellectual skill as the most important skill followed by personal and technical skill. Whereas, employers rated interpersonal skill as the most needed skill by accounting students, followed by intellectual and personal skill. Findings show that there are significant gaps between students need and employers expectation regarding the importance of professional skill. Thus, this paper suggests continuous improvements must be made by the accounting curriculum and professional skills should be emphasized in order for the universities to produce good quality graduates. This paper argues that, unlike many recently proposed and sometimes inaugurated educational innovations – theoretical or methodological, inquiry learning is founded on a strong historical and philosophical base. Following John Dewey’s warning, about conducting education under the control of customs and traditions that have never been examined, or in response to immediate social pressures, the inquiry approach does offer some clear idea of the ends in the way of ruling attitudes or desire or purpose that are to be created. The paper first defines inquiry learning and then outlines its evolutionary history This research was aimed to determine the influence of teacher qualification factors, namely type of teacher training and teaching experience on secondary school teachers’ efficacy in Sabah. Data were collected using the Teachers’ Sense of Efficacy Scale which involved 928 teachers from 22 secondary school in four districts. ANOVA analysis found significant mean difference in all dimensions of teacher efficacy according to type of teacher training and teaching experience. Finding also showed that teachers with Diploma in Malaysian Education obtained the highest level of efficacy, compared to teachers from the other programs. Teachers with teaching more than seven years of teaching experience were statistically different in efficacy than those with less teaching experience. The research suggested that well-trained graduate teachers should be given more opportunity to teach in positive teaching environment to enable them to develop positive teacher efficacy. Principals are the key individuals responsible for managing the curriculum and co-curriculum. In reality principals involvement, in managing co-curricular activities in schools is lacking compare to curriculum. But in reality than the curriculum, involvement in co-curricular activities in schools to manage is lacking. They are often tied up to the routine work in managing and governing of the school. It is indirectly hamper efforts to improve the management of the school co-curriculum. This study aims to examine the perspective of cocurricular advisory teacher towards the role of principal in managing the cocurricular at national secondary schools in the Zone of Keramat, Kuala Lumpur. The role of principal is examined based on the aspects as planner, coordinator, leader and controller of cocurricular. The sample studies consists of 323 teachers who are currently serving and hold the task as an advisor of cocurricular in 12 national secondary schools in the Zone of Keramat, Kuala Lumpur. The sample selection is based on simple random sampling. Data were collected using a questionnaire that had been made prior pilot studies for validity and reliability of the instrument. The descriptive analysis involving the mean and standard deviation found perspective on the roles of teachers as planner (mean = 3.79), organizer (mean = 3.81), the leader (mean = 3.79), and the controller (mean = 3.90), all of which are at high level. In conclusion, the finding of this study shows the importance of a school principal to practice effective management role so that teachers and students are more motivated to ensure the success of cocurricular activities in school.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.17576/JPEN-2015-4002-05 This study using ex post facto design had two purposes. First, it attempted to fi nd out if there was any relationship between the process of reading in EGP (English for General Purposes) and ESP (English for Specicfi c Purposes). Second, it intended to investigate if the EGP reading process would correlates with the EGP and ESP reading product. Thirty nine Iranian tertiary level students received reading comprehension tests as well as reading strategy questionnaires in EGP and ESP. Based on the mean score of the EGP reading strategy questionnaire the participants were classifi ed into two groups of low and high awareness and use of reading strategies. Analysis of data using one-way ANOVA and multivariate analysis of variance evinced the high group had more awareness and use of strategies in ESP and outperformed the low group in ESP reading comprehension test. However, no signifi cant difference was found in EGP reading comprehension test between the two groups. It was concluded that awareness and use of strategies in EGP coupled with content knowledge would be a good predictor of a successful academic reading performance. EGP teachers would be able to improve the strategic reading competence of students to be transferred to ESP reading tasks. ESP practitioners would be able to do needs analysis for content reading courses so that possible defi ciencies in strategic competence would not result in ineffi ciency in ESP reading The objective of this study is to investigate the use of computer-animated instruction to improve students’ conceptual understanding in chemistry concepts. The sample consisted of 70 fi rst year Diploma Pharmacy students who were randomly selected. This study used the pre-test-post-test quasi experimental group design. The treatment group was taught using computer-animated instruction, while the control group was taught using white-board drawing instruction. A Conceptual Performance Test consisting of visual and verbal conceptual questions was used to measure students’ conceptual understanding. The t-Test was employed to analyze students’ conceptual understanding test score. The fi ndings indicated that computer-animated instruction group did not outperform signifi cantly [t(65)=1.50, p=0.15] in the visual conceptual questions compared to whiteboard drawing instruction group. Autism is a developmental disorder that negatively impacts the ability for communication and interaction. Current statistics have reported an increase in its prevalence. Therefore, the need for well trained teachers to teach children with autism has also increased. This study was implemented to investigate the level of training, knowledge, and confidence of special education teachers on autism. Formal teacher training courses was found to be rather ineffective in training special education teachers to understand and teach children with autism. It has also been found that inservice training is slightly better in quality. This caused them to have low confidence in their ability to teach children with autism. However, they showed interest to undergo advanced courses to enhance their competence in educating children with autism. Therefore, formal special education teacher training needs to be improved through an additional component on autism. Special education teachers also need to be provided with access to inservice training in autism because the field of autism education has progressed and various strategies that have been proven effective scientifically are now available. Further studies are needed to identify weaknesses in both types of teacher training and methods to improve the quality of both in terms on education for children with autism. The use of teaching aids in teaching Arabic language still needs to be improved, especially in Sekolah Agama Bantuan Kerajaan (SABK) . This descriptive study was conducted to identify the techniques, practices and frequency in teaching aids used by Arabic teacher with Bu’uth al-Azhar curriculum. The study was implemented in two schools (SABK) in Negeri Selangor. The questionnaires were distributed to 20 teachers and 150 students . The findings showed that the mean value of teaching techniques in the classroom from the teachers’ perspective (mean = 4.15) and students’ perspective (mean = 3.82) both were at high level. In addition, the mean value in the practice of teaching and teaching in the classroom from the teacher’s perspective (mean = 3:47) and students (mean = 3.96) were also high. However, the mean of the frequency of teaching aids used from the teacher’s perspective (mean = 2:18) and students (mean = 2:16) were at a low level. This findings indicate that positive attitude towards the teaching practices and techniques, but this positive attitudes does not work out with the students and teachers in matter of teaching aids used. Therefore, the use of teaching aids (BBM) has to be considered comprehensive, especially in Sekolah Agama Bantuan Kerajaan (SABK). The aims of this study are: (1) To identify the level of motivation in learning Arabic listening skills, (2) To identify the level of Arabic listening skills, (3) To identify the relationship between motivation and Arabic listening skills, and (4) To identify the differences between three group, namely high, moderate, and low motivation. This study used the cross sectional research design and employed two research instruments to collect the data, namely questionnaire and Arabic listening test. The results showed: (a) the motivation at the high level, (b) the Arabic listening skills at the moderate level, (c) there was a significant relationships between motivation and Arabic listening skills, and (d) there was a significant differences between the three group Dissatisfaction towards language proficiency among students that is the inability of students to use the Malay language to express their thoughts and knowledge has been repeatedly discussed in the Malay language teaching. On the whole, our students pass the exam but do not show the language capabilities in line with its status as the language of science, the language of the modern world relations and the national language. Thus, the process of teaching and effective language learning is needed to enable them to understand and make use of a word in Malay with the right terms and semantic principles. This study was conducted to highlight an alternative strategy in the teaching and learning of grammar. In general, this study focuses on the use of software programmes in Google search engine, in which antconc software is used to analyze corpus –based data from DBP’s Data Base System. This study shows how the programme is capable to help students understand the differences in the use of words that are synonyms, since this kind of words often creates confusion, especially when they try to understand the difference in meaning leading errors in usage. It can be concluded that the process of teaching grammar using Computer Assisted Teaching and Learning approach has proposed an alternative strategy in the teaching and learning of grammar. This strategy is able to supply a wide range of linguistic information to students, particularly in relation to the language system and examines the dynamic characteristics of a word and sentence. This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of a generic skills instrument, namely Malaysian Generic Skills Instrument (MyGSI). This study used 81 MyGSI items from the original 149 items after it was analyzed using the Gender Differential Item Functioning (GDIF). The instrument was administered on 127 Malay Language teacher trainees. MyGSI measures three construct: communication skills, leadership and teamwork by using five point Likert scale. Rasch model were used to test the validity and reliability of MyGSI because it can measure the reliability of individual items as well and be able to show results and analysis related to individual items in one similar linear column. Winsteps version 3.64.2 was used in the test instrument. Reliability index values obtained for individual construct communication, leadership and teamwork skills is between 0.86 to 0.90. The value index of item reliability for the three constructs are between 0.71 to 0.90. This study also presents an order of items according to level of difficulty according to levels agreed upon by the Malay Language teacher trainees. Hierarchy items according to increased level of difficulty indicated that MyGSI instruments proven to have\n",
      "52 While looking for a reputable publisher to propose my own journal, Mr. Beall\\'s blog (http://scholarlyoa.com) astonished me. An accumulated list of over 740 Predatory Publishers (Beall 2012a, Beall 2012b) contains many names, which often show up in my email box. Is there any uncorrupted publishers? Yes, there are decent open-access publishers. Blue chip companies hosting hundreds of journals which charge $2000-5000 per accepted manuscript. Few small publishers charge a reasonable amount of money, but only can host less than ten journals due to limited sources. Can scientists operate our own journal? We surely can. We are trained to be able to learn anything. This kind of successful stories is rare, but always inspiring us. By launching this journal, I want to show our scientific attitudes.Our Scientific Attitudes A scientific journal should be run by scholars, scientists, researchers, and engineers. Since we are not businessmen, we mind scientific values. Making a good journal is the most important thing. I have seen that a SCI journal decreased its impact factor from 1.5 to 0.3 within 5 years, and understood how hard to maintain a reputable publication. The goal of this journal is to pass EI Compendex review within 5 years, and be included in SCI index within 7 years. In order to make a good journal and achieve these goals, it needs the collaborative effort among our editorial board members, authors, reviewers, and all contributors. We show respect for scholars. The first two volumes of the journal are free of any charge to authors. The length of this Article Processing Charge (APC) waive period may be extended, if the editorial board thought it\\'s necessary. We show respect to our editors, editorial board members, and reviewers. After the APC waive period, we will waive APC for manuscripts submitted by our editorial team, and provide 50% discount to reviewers. Citation: Zhang, B.

DOI: 10.17737/tre.2015.1.1.001 These three papers cover the overall methodology for the identification and localization of faults that occur in main transmission and distribution lines when broadband over power lines (BPL) networks are deployed across the transmission and distribution power grids, respectively. In fact, this fault case is the only one that cannot be handled by the combined operation of Topology Identification Methodology (TIM) and Instability Identification Methodology (FIIM). After the phase of identification of main distribution line faults, which is presented in this paper, the main line fault localization methodology (MLFLM) is applied in order to localize the faults in overhead medium-voltage BPL (OV MV BPL) networks.The main contribution of this paper, which is focused on the identification of the main distribution line faults, is the presentation of TM2 method extension through the adoption of coupling reflection coefficients. Extended TM2 method is analyzed in order to identify a main distribution line fault regardless of its nature (i.e., short- or open-circuit termination). The behavior of the extended TM2 method is assessed in terms of the main line fault nature and, then, its results are compared against the respective ones during the normal operation, which are given by the original TM2 method, when different main distribution line fault scenarios occur. Extended TM2 method acts as the introductory phase (fault identification) of MLFLM. This paper investigates the possibility of detecting the hook style energy theft in the overhead low-voltage (OV LV) power grids through the hook style energy theft method (HS-DET method) when ad-hoc overhead Low-Voltage Broadband over Power Lines (OV LV BPL) networks are deployed by the Information Technology departments of the power utilities. Without the need for the deployment of a complete and permanent OV LV BPL network across the OV LV power grid, the impact of the deviation from the initial measurement positions and of longer ad-hoc OV LV BPL topologies on the detection efficiency of HS-DET method is assessed by using the already validated percent error sum (PES) metrics and appropriate contour plots.Citation: Lazaropoulos, A.

But considering advantages of these novel energy technologies along with the benefits of environmental and economic factors, we believe that renewable energy is still one of fastest developing areas. In 2015, governments showed their visions on the development of renewable energy technologies. US Department of Energy granted numerous projects related to clean energy, energy efficacy, energy conservation, and renewable energy technologies. In December 2015, USDA-EPA-DOE released the Biogas Opportunities Roadmap Progress Report, in which challenges and opportunities for the robust biogas industry are outlined. We are expecting that this growing trend of renewable energy will be extended through 2016 and 2017.We will continue the TRE’s mission to publish quality reviews, original research, and application-oriented papers, providing a communication platform that is run exclusively by scientists working in the renewable energy field. Papers are invited on any individual topic related to renewable energy or those that are interdisciplinary. The article processing charge (APC), i.e. the publication fee, is fully waived for papers published during 2016. This paper is a strive approach to design offgrid solar system in association with DC-DC boost converter and MPPT. The tuned PID based MPPT technique is adopted to extract maximum power from the solar system under certain circumstances (temperature and irradiance). The design parameters of PID controller play an imperative aspect to enhance the performance of the system. Ant lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithm is adopted to optimize PID parameters to contribute relevant duty cycle for DC-DC boost converter to maximize output power and voltage. P and O based MPPT technique is implemented to validate the supremacy of PID based MPPT to enhance the response of the system. In this paper, the proposed ALO optimized PID controller based MPPT technique is performed better over conventional P & O technique by conceding the oscillation, time response, settling time and maximum values of voltage, current and power of the solar system.Citation: SAHU, R.

DOI: 10.17737/tre.2018.4.3.0049 Due to the significant volatility of Broadband over Power Lines (BPL) networks regarding their circuital and topological characteristics, channel statistical modeling recently gains special attention from the BPL communications engineers. Among the recently presented channel attenuation statistical models, initial statistical hybrid model (iSHM) and modified statistical hybrid model (mSHM) have been theoretically defined and applied to overhead medium voltage (OV MV), underground medium voltage (UN MV) and overhead high voltage (OV HV) BPL networks so far. Apart from the iSHM and mSHM definition and application, the theory of the definition procedure of new virtual distribution and transmission BPL topologies, which describes the phases towards defining statistically equivalent BPL topologies and topology subclasses to the real indicative ones, has been demonstrated as well as the class maps, which are 2D capacity contour plots with respect to the channel attenuation statistical distributions (CASDs) parameters of iSHM and mSHM.In this pair of papers, iSHM, mSHM, the definition procedure of new virtual BPL topologies and the class mapping are first applied to overhead low voltage (OV LV) BPL networks. Based on the class maps and the BPL topology database of Topology Identification Methodology (TIM), the required theory for illustrating the footprint of the real OV LV BPL topologies is first presented on class maps in this paper. On the basis of the class maps and the BPL topology database of Fault and Instability Identification Methodology (FIIM), the required theory for illustrating the footprint of the OV LV BPL topologies with branch line faults is first identified on class maps in this paper. On the basis of the class maps and the BPL topology database of hook style energy theft detection method (HS-DET method), the required theory for illustrating the footprint of the OV LV BPL topologies with a hook style energy theft is first demonstrated on class maps in this paper.Citation: Lazaropoulos, A.

Papers are invited on any individual topic related to renewable energy or those that are interdisciplinary. A good working knowledge of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is of vital requirement for determining the terrestrial photosynthesis, primary productivity calculation, ecosystem-atmosphere carbon dioxide, plant physiology, biomass production, natural illumination in greenhouses, radiation climate, remote sensing of vegetation, and radiation regimes of plant canopy, photosynthesis, productivity models of vegetation, etc. However, routine measurement of PAR is not available in most location of interest across the globe. During the past 77 years in order to estimate PAR on hourly, daily and monthly mean basis, several empirical models have been developed for numerous locations globally. As a result, numerous input parameters have been utilized and different functional forms applied. This study was aim at classifying and reviewing the empirical models employed for estimating PAR across the globe. The empirical models so far utilized were classified into ten main categories and presented base on the input parameters applied. The models were further reclassified into numerous main sub-classes (groups) and finally presented according to their developing year. In general, 757 empirical models, 62 functional forms and 32 groups were reported in literature for estimating PAR across the globe. The empirical models utilized were equally compared with models developed using different artificial neural network (ANN); and the result\n",

Argumentative writing plays an important role in academic writing at university level. However, learners mostly find that writing this essay a challenging and effortful task. This present study aims at exploring the structures of argumentative essay written by Indonesian EFL students from one university in Jakarta Indonesia. Moreover, it investigates their difficulty and constraints during composing the essay. Using a descriptive qualitative design, the authors selected writing assignment and questionnaire for collecting data. A layout of Toulmin model of arguments was used in analyzing the essays. The findings of the study show that the argumentative papers cover the main elements: claim (thesis statement), data, rebut, and rebuttal data using either in block pattern or point-by-point pattern. The elements show diverse in types. Logical analysis and explanation are the most frequently used on the papers. Though they present acceptable thesis with well-organized essay, some information is unrelated and data for supporting the claim are seemingly insufficient. In addition, the students think that this essay as difficult task. In general, lack of knowledge, vocabulary and practice cause the constraints. In specific level, the students report that giving argument, finding support and working on counterargument become source of difficulty and constraints. The problems of this research were how to improve vocabulary using comic and how to motivate the students to apply it in their English. The research was guided by a conceptual framework leading to the using comic through peer work to improve their motivation to speak English during the process of classroom communication interaction. The research type was an action research. The subject consisted of 20 students of the first grade of SMK Al Hidayah 1 Cilandak in 2015-2016 academic years. The research data were collected using test (test after first treatment and test after the second treatment), observation for collecting data on the students’ motivation in improving vocabulary ability using series pictures. Data on vocabulary ability using comic were analyzed using the descriptive and statistic analysis, to know the improvement in mean students after the first cycle and the second cycle. Based on the first cycle, the students’ average was 67.8, then, on the second treatment, the students’ average increase to be 78.8. It can conclude that teaching vocabulary using comic can improve students’ vocabulary ability.Key words: improve, vocabulary, comic This research shows that the origins of the confusion surroundings the theoretical status of cyber technology memes today could be found in culture. Those memes later developed in memetics the science of memes. Memes are a common way for individuals to communicate online. Internet users often use memes to reply to each other on social networking sites or other online forums. This research argues that memes are successfully used for communication purposes because certain memes (specifically image macros) are essentially speech acts and are also understood as being speech acts by internet users. When creating a meme, choices are made concerning the specific semiotic resources to be used and the internet community then interprets these resources to facilitate communication between the meme creator and the internet community. Memes can be recreated for different purposes and therefore it is possible to group memes under already existing speech acts and speculate about the ways in which these might correspond to speech acts in the future.\n",
      "58 Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a common, long-lasting consequence of acute cerebrovascular events (ACE). Aim. To assess the rate and intensity of PSF over the second year after strokes and transient ischemic attacks. Material and methods. Initially patients were followed up and examined in 12 months (201 cases) and finally in 24 months (126 cases) after ACE occurrence; through these time intervals patients were examined quarterly. PSF was measured by fatigue assessment scale (FAS), multidimensional fatigue inventory-20 (MFI-20) and fatigue severity scale (FSS). Results. According to FAS and FSS, rate of PSF over the second year after ACE occurrence were unchangeable within narrow limits, 31,7%-33,0%. Rates of global, physical, mental, activity-related and motivational post-stroke fatigue, according to MFI-20, were also stable, within 25,0%-28,6%, 24,6%-27,4%, 27,8%-30,2%, 22,4%-26,2% and 19,4%-22,0%, respectively. Patients with strokes, compared with transient ischemic attack patients, had more common general, physical, mental, motivational and activity-related post-stroke fatigue domains in 12 and 15 months after ACE occurrence. Intensity of PSF due to FAS (range – 29,0 (26,0-33,0) – 28,0 (26,0-32,2)) and FSS (5,5 (5,2-5,9) – 4,8 (4,5-5,2)), as well as intensity of physical (13,0 (12,0-13,0) – 12,0 (12,0-13,0)) and activity-related (13,0 (12,0-13,0) – 12,0 (12,0-13,5)) PSF domains due to MFI-20, was statistically stable, whereas severity of global (14,0 (13,0-15,0) – 13,0 (12,0-14,0)), mental (15,0 (14,0-16,0) – 13,0 (12,0-14,0)) and motivational (15,0 (14,0-16,0) – 13,0 (13,0-15,0)) PSF domains significantly decreased through the second year after ACE. Conclusion. 1. PSF rate as well as PSF dimension rates were stable over the second year after ACE regardless the fatigue scales used. 2. Intensity of gobal, mental and motivational post-stroke fatigue domains, according to MFI-20, significantly decreased over the second year after ACE occurrence. More than 30% of patients with chronic paraproctitis are found out to present complex forms of this pathology. They are often complicated with the external sphincter incontinence due to the deformation of the anal canal and cicatricial changes in the anal constrictors. The deficiency of the anal sphincter is observed in 4.9-33% of patients, and recurrent operations on the rectum are often accompanied by the development of elements of neurogenic and motor incontinence resulted from the massive sphincter trauma. Objective. To conduct a comparative analysis of the results of surgical treatment for chronic paraproctitis between standard method of surgical treatment and a method we proposed. Objects and methods. 58 patients with extrasphincteric anal fistulas of varying degrees of severity operated on by applying two methods were involved into this study: the group 1 included 32 patients who were operated on by using the Seton method; the second group consisted of 26 patients who were operated on by using the new method with applying “Tachocomb” preparation. Results. Early postoperative complications were noted in 37.5% of patients in the first clinical group, and 15.4% in the second group. In six months of follow-up period, the pressure values in the internal sphincter at rest in the second group exceeded those in the patients operated on by using the standard technique. 6 patients (18.8%) operated by using the standard method the recurrence of fistula was observed in 6 months following the operation; 11 (34.4%) patients demonstrated satisfactory results, and 15 (46.8%) were found to have good functional results. In the second clinical group, 16 patients (61.5%) were found to have good results; 8 people (30.7%) had satisfactory results and only 1 patient (5.9%) had fistula recurrence. The results of treatment were evaluated in 3, 6, 12 and 18 months following the operations, and the minimum terms of patients’ monitoring were more than one year. Conclusions. Thus, the good and satisfactory long-term results of treatment for high rectal fistulas in patients of the second clinical grpup operated on by applying the newly developed method with «Tachocomb» allow us to recommend the method to widely implement into the clinical practice for patients with extra- and trans-sphincteric fistulas of the 3rd - 4th degrees of severity. The conscious daily choice of the healthy food contributes to preserving health and high working capacity, including mental performance. Milk and sour-milk products make up the essential part of students’ daily diet needed to supply the body with all necessary nutrients and energy. The aim of this study is to assess daily consumption of milk and sour-milk products in order to correct the students’ diet. Materials and methods: Using the questionnaire [6], the authors questioned medical students and analyzed obtained results on the medical students’ dietary habits.&nbsp;The study involved the 2nd, 4th and 6th study year students of O. Bogomolets National medical university. The survey participation was voluntary by obtaining prior consent from students. The sample was&nbsp; selected randomly. The sample includes 858 respondents, 570 female and 288 male students aged 18-25 years. Results: The study represents the results of comparative assessment of the recommended daily consumption of milk and sour-milk products with their real consumption. The authors have evaluated daily consumption of such dairy products as milk, kefir, yoghurt, sour cream, butter, hard cheese and cottage cheese. The consumption of milk, kefir, yoghurt and sour cream was estimated by the following grading: “I don’t consume these products”, “I consume not more than 250 ml of such products daily”, “I consume 250-400 ml of such products daily”, “I consume more than 400 ml of these products daily”. The consumption of hard cheese was evaluated by the grading: “I don’t consume it”, “I consume not more than 10g daily”, “ I consume about 10-20g of it daily”, “I consume more than 20g of it daily”; cottage cheese: “I don’t consume it at all”, “I consume not more than 100g daily”, “I consume 100-200g of it daily”, “I consume more than 200g of it daily”; butter: “I don’t consume it”, “I consume not more than 15g of it daily”, “I consume more than 15 g of it daily”. The study has found that one third of the respondents do not consume whole milk, regardless of sex and the year of study. Less than 20% of respondents daily consume 250-400 ml of milk. Half of the junior student respondents do not consume sour-milk products at all regardless of sex.&nbsp; 20% of the junior students and 20-30% of the senior respondents consume 250-400 ml of sour-milk products daily irrespective of sex. No more than one third of respondents irrespective to sex or year of study consume 10-20g of hard cheese daily. 100-200g of cottage cheese (low-fat) is usually included into the daily diet of 10-30% respondents, and there is dependency on the sex and year of study. The high-fat cottage cheese is not eaten by a half of the respondents irrespective to the sex and year of study; while 10% of junior students and 20% of senior students regardless of the sex include 100-200g of it in their daily diet. About 20% of male respondents irrespective their year of study and 30% of female respondents do not eat butter at all. Conclusions. The results obtained show numerous deviations from national recommendations on healthy nutrition and point out existing risks of the nutritional deficiencies, alimentary and alimentary-dependent diseases. The students’ youth diet and the attitude toward the healthy diet require serious correction. The relevance of issues on polytrauma is determined by the constant increase in the number of road accidents, armed conflicts, terrorist acts, accompanied by the appearance of a large number of casualties with severe and extremely serious injuries. The purpose of study was to analyze the recent reports of relevant scientific literature and the results of our own experimental research to summarize data on current trends and relevance of studying the main factors determining the development of disorders in victims with pelvic fractures in combination with multiple and combined injuries, to enhance the prognostic criteria based on a comprehensive assessment of the clinical course of the disease and to improve the treatment by promoting reparative regeneration of bone tissue with platelet-rich plasma. Materials and methods.Through the period from 2017 to 2018, 35 patients with polytrauma were operated on at the Traumatology Department of the Municipal Clinical Emergency and Medical Care Hospital of Zaporizhzhia. Among the patients there were 19 men (54.29%) and 16 women (45.71%) aged from 23 to 77 years, mean age was 39 years. 22 persons (62.86%) had road traffic injuries, 10 (28.57%) had domestic injuries, 2 (5.71%) had occupational injuries and 1 patient (2.86%) had other type of traumas. ISS scale injury less than 17 scores was found in 20 patients (57.14%), injuries varying from 17 to 25 scores – in 12 (34.29%), from 26 to 40 scores – in 2 (5.71%), and injury assessed as more than 40 scores was found in 1 (2.86%) patient. All patients (100%) were verified to have pelvic bone injuries varying degrees. The injuries of pelvic girdle were more often combined with fractures of the proximal femur against the background of traumatic brain injury and were diagnosed in 17 cases (48.57%); the same type of trauma with concomitant fractures of extremities of other localization was detected in 12 cases (34.29%). There were diagnosed 11 cases (31.43%) of above mentioned traumas complicated with intraperitoneal injury, 9 cases (25.71%) complicated with vertebral fractures, and 6 cases (17.14%) complicated with chest trauma). Results and discussion. In the main group of patients receiving the treatment with platelet-rich plasma, radiologically visible union of the injured area developed in 10 people (83.33%) in 8 weeks. 1 patient (8.3%) developed the synosteosis in 12 weeks and 1 patient (8.3%) developed synosteosis in 16 weeks following the surgery. In the control group fusion was detected in 14 patients (60.87%) in 8 weeks and in 8 patients (34.78%) in 16 weeks. Conclusion. Reliably substantiated data were obtained according to the results of the analysis of contingency tables 4*4 and the calculation of χ2 for the efficiency coefficient according to the Wald formula (Chi-square 6.87 with p=0.009) that indicates better clinical effectiveness of the technique due to the additional introduction of platelet-rich plasma into the treatment mode in order to assess the dynamics of fracture consolidation processes in victims with multiple and concomitant injuries. The results obtained allow us to predict a favourable outcome in these patients. In recent years, the concept of \\\"metabolic syndrome\\\" has become more spreading, and in parallel with disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, endothelial dysfunction is no less significant. The aim of our work was to analyze changes in homocysteine (HC) as a marker of metabolic syndrome in patients with an increased body mass index (IBMI) in polytrauma. The study involved 224 patients with polytrauma, who had different initial values of body mass index (BMI) and were treated at the polytrauma department and the intensive care unit for patients with combined injuries for a period from 1 day to 1 year since the moment of injury. All the patients were subjected to identifying the level of serum HC. The patients had the same severity according to the APACHE II scale, 14 ± 5.8, at the admission to the hospital, and were divided into 3 stratified clinical groups depending on the initial values of anthropometric parameters and BMI. The study was conducted on the 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 and 360 days from the date of polytrauma. Assessment of blood serum HC was performed by ELISA. It was found that the overweight patients with BMI ≤ 29.9 demonstrated an increase in the mean values of blood HC on the 7th and 14th days of the treatment, with a further decrease on the 15th day since the date of injury. For the patients with BMI within the range of 30.0 - 39.9, the persistence of the HC index during the first month of the treatment at baseline with an increase on the 360th day was found out. The patients with BMI ˃&nbsp;40.0 showed an increase in the level of blood HC through the year since the date of polytrauma. It was revealed that the level of HС directly affects the course of traumatic disease in patients with increased BMI, its severity in terms of uniformity of injuries received and the same\n",
      "59 This study was encouraged by the importance of understanding the conditions of seagrass which becomes the source of food for many species of marine fish. Seagrass condition will indirectly affect the quantity and quality of fish obtained by fishermen who live in coastal areas. High-resolution imagery can simplify and accelerate data collection process of conditions of seagrass on the outer islands of Gorontalo Province. This study used digital remote sensing method using unsupervised classification and also assisted by the measurements of the transcule based on the pixel size that aims to detect and to match the information obtained from QuickBird imagery, to ultimately obtain information about seagrass condition. Seagrass with abundant/good condition can be found at station 1,3,4,5, and 6 with an average cover up to 67,70%, 63,54%, 68,75%, 62,5%, and 65,62% respectively. Meanwhile, seagrass with the less abundant/poor condition can be found at station 2 with an average cover up to 50% and at station 7 with an average cover up to 52,08%. Distribution of seagrass on Saronde Island covers up to 6. 9654 Ha. Seagrass with abundant/good condition covers 4,2025 Ha, and lowly abundant/poor seagrass covers 2,7629 Ha. Seagrass on Saronde Island is still in abundant/good condition with an average cover up to 61,45 % and form mixed vegetation. Jeneponto Regency is one of the biggest corn producers in South Sulawesi. Jeneponto Regency is the most suitable area for estimating corn crop production because it is the largest corn-producing region in South Sulawesi Province and has quite complex terrain variations. Agricultural management requires accurate and accurate information or data that can increase productivity and economic benefits. Get accurate and up-to-date data or information about parts of an accurate agricultural information system to support proper planning. The purpose of this study is to map climatic conditions (rainfall) and physical conditions (slope, height, soil type) and to estimate the amount of corn production and maize production maps through spatial assessment. This research was conducted in the Jeneponto Regency, which is located in the southern part of the South Sulawesi Province. The results of the study show that spatial ecology based on agro-ecosystem zones or agricultural unit units in the estimation of special maize production can increase estimation results with high accuracy. Based on the analysis of the four physical maps that have been mapped are rainfall, soil type, slope, and height which are regulated in the agro-ecosystem zone, the estimated amount with spatial ecological calculations is 159.584,05 tons. The accuracy of the estimation model results with field data reaches 95%. Based on the results of the study can conclude the results of spatial ecological research can be used as a method of estimating production on corn. Gorontalo City is one of the regions in Gorontalo Province. Urban development and population growth, causing pressure on land use patterns. Changes in land use are carried out to meet the community\\'s needs for infrastructure. At present, development in Gorontalo City is still ongoing. The increase in temperature is expected to continue and can trigger heat island. This is very important to be studied for the Gorontalo City development planning that is more environmentally friendly. This study aims to analyze the heat island phenomenon through the relationship of the spatial distribution of surface temperature with various types of land cover and vegetation characteristics. The object of this research is the Gorontalo City area on Landsat path-row 121- 65 satellite imagery media. The research material is the wavelength of visible light, near-infrared and moderate infrared and thermal wavelengths on satellite imagery of Landsat TM and OLI TIRS. The results showed an increase in temperature in Gorontalo City since 1990, 2003, and 2017. The correlation between surface temperature and land cover is negative. The value of the correlation coefficient (r) in 1990 was -0.41. The correlation coefficient (r) in 2003 was -0.448. The correlation coefficient (r) in 2017 is -0.402. Changes in surface temperature in Gorontalo City are influenced by changes in the land cover which is marked by the similarity of patterns of changes in surface temperature distribution with patterns of land cover changes. The research area located in the lowland zone and the corrugated hilly zone which is dominated by sedimentary rocks. Therefore, this study aims to determine the geological features of the research area and the study of depositional environmental facies of the Lake Deposits Formation as an analysis of the depositional environment of Limboto Lake. The research method used is the surface geological mapping, measuring a section of stratigraphic and laboratory analysis. Field data consists of stratigraphical features of the research area. Laboratory analysis consists of petrography and stratigraphy-sedimentology analysis. It can be concluded facies and stratigraphy of research from older to youngest, consists of clastic limestones unit formed in Late Miocene-late Early Pliocene age, reef limestones formed in Late Miocene-early Late Pliocene age, sandstones unit formed in Late Pliocene-Pleistocene age, clay unit, and sandy clay unit are deposited in Holocene. Overall the study site consisted of marine, transitional and terrestrial deposition environment with Lake Deposits Formation facies is lake margin clastic deposits and meandering-stream environment deposits. Land suitability evaluation is a process of assessing the potential of land for a particular use, whether in agriculture, plantation, tourism, land conservation, or other types of use. This study aims to determine the land suitability class for durian plants in Aranio District and determine the inhibiting factors on the land using the matching method. The population in this study was 12 land units and each unit was taken 2 samples. Land units are obtained from overlay maps of landforms, slope maps, geological maps, soil association maps, and land use maps. The results showed that the land in Aranio District was included in the suitability class S2 (moderately suitable) with an area of 15069.68 hectares or 33.13%, S3 (marginally suitable) with an area of 1485.78 hectares or 3.27%, and N1 (not current suitable) with an area of 3980.03 hectares or 8.75%. The limiting factor is slope, erosion hazard, pH, soil depth, surface rock, alkaline saturation, flood hazard, phosphate, K2O, and N-Total. The villages in the Aranio sub-district are used to develop durian plants because they have land suitability classes of S2 and the use of shrubs, fields, and mixed gardens are above 50%, namely Tiwingan Baru and Tiwingan Lama villages. Gorontalo is located at the macro and micro plate boundary, therefore it is located in an active seismotectonic region. This study aims to analyze earthquake damage level in Gorontalo based on seismicity and peak ground acceleration. The data used is obtained from the USGS. Data is made into a database and plotted onto a geological map. Calculation of peak ground acceleration is obtained using the Kawashumi formula. The results of this study indicate that Gorontalo is included in the slight to moderate earthquake damage level because it is dominated by shallow to intermediate earthquakes depth, light to moderate earthquake magnitude, and have a peak ground acceleration 1,462 - 99,714 gal. Steam power plant construction and operation is an effort to meet electricity needs. In Indonesia, two steam power plants were built and changed the landscape in Cirebon. The presence of Cirebon steam power plants has disturbed the community and potential to decrease air quality. This study aims to estimate air quality changes around the power plants based on remote sensing satellite imageries. The main data in this study obtained from Landsat-8 OLI (2019) and Landsat-7 ETM (2004) satellite imageries were processed with four parameters of air quality algorithm namely PM10, CO, SO2, and NOx on AOI with ranging of 2000 m from the source point. Validation uses comparative data from MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSS satellite imageries in the same period. Changes analysis in air quality used the Mann-Whitney method (U-Test). This research shows that the Landsat series satellite imagery is suitable to be used as the main data for estimating air quality because it has a similar pattern to comparable data. The Cirebon PLTU operation caused a significant increase in CO levels of 1.25 mg/l on a wide range. In other air quality parameters such as PM10, SO2 and NOx were decreased. Landslide occurrence can be influenced by physical factors and human activities. Thus, research related to the provision of information about landslide distribution in Alo watershed is needed as a basis in enhancing community preparedness in dealing with disasters. The method used in this study is the scoring method based on the Minister of Public Works Regulation No.22 / PRT / M / 2017 which is processed through a geographical information system through the overlay of all physical parameters. The result shows that the Alo watershed area is divided into three vulnerability categories. \\\"Low\\\" category covers 7171.8 ha, \\\"medium\\\" category covers 12008.7 ha, and \\\"high\\\" category covers 5039.5 ha out of 24.221 ha the total area of Alo watershed. Information provided in this research is expected to be able to help the local government in making policies in managing the Alo watershed area and enhancing the understanding of the local community in Alo watershed in dealing with disasters. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed by calcium carbonate derived from the rest of marine organisms and the main materials of cement so exploration and calculation of limestone resources need to be done. The research area is administratively located at the Biluhu Timur Village and its surroundings, Batudaa Pantai District, Gorontalo Regency. The purpose of this study is to observe the geological conditions of the study area to determine distribution of limestones in the study area to be used as cement industrial materials with the geological mapping, and the analysis limestone geochemical using XRF (X-Ray Flourescence). Based on the result of this research can be concluded that the research area was devided into four geomorphological units, consisting of volcanic hills unit, denudational hills and plain unit, and the coastal plain unit. The litology arranged by granodiorit, basal, and the limestone (packstone and wackestone).

This study aims to analyze the spatial distribution of coliform and E. coli in groundwater Gorontalo City and the factors that influence it. The sampling locations were taken from 9 sub-districts consisting of 27 villages. The nine sub-districts consist of Dumbo Raya, Hulondalangi Kota Barat, Kota Utara, Kota Timur, Kota Selatan, Sipatana, Dungingi, and Padebuolo Districts. Sampling in each village consisted of 1 sample and was taken randomly. Kota Utara Sub-district consisted of 1 sample location, namely Dembe Jaya Village. Kota Timur Sub-district consists of 2 villages, namely Padebuolo and Heledulaan Selatan villages. Kota Selatan sub-district consists of Limba U 1. Kota Tengah sub-district consists of Liluwo Village. The Sipatana sub-district consists of Tanggikiki, Bulotadaa, and Tapa Villages. Dungingi sub-district consists of Tulandenggi and Libuo Villages. The total number of samples was 27. The analysis was carried out at the Gorontalo District Health Office, UPTD of Water Quality Laboratory Installation. The sampling method was carried out aseptically. Measurements in the laboratory used the MPN method. The quality standard that became the reference was Permenkes (Health Minister Regulation) number 32 of 2017 Annex 1 regarding water for sanitation and hygiene. The results of the analysis showed that the distribution of the number of coliform bacteria, in general, was at the quality standard set. A total of 24 villages of 27 locations were above the established quality standard. Regarding the number of E. coli bacteria from 27 locations, there were 5 locations\n",
      "60 Between 2010 and 2011, the Fidesz-KDNP government carried out a number of legal, social and political reforms, including voting in a new constitution. Through analysis of this new constitution and amendments made to its predecessor, this article aims to understand the influence of the recent changes to the Hungarian constitutional framework with regard to the country’s rule of law. Based on the theoretical definition of the rule of law, it can be argued that principles such as balance of power, constitutionality of laws, legality of administration, and independence of the judiciary and the media have been undermined in Hungary. Personal dignity, freedom, justice and security have also been undermined. As a result of these decisions, the number of voices critical of Orbán’s government has grown. Among their numbers stands the European Union, which sees Hungary as the first Member State to deviate from the union’s democratic values The election of Donald Trump as America’s forty-fifth president took much of the world by surprise. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump assured the electorate that he would solve the nation’s problems and implement an “America First” strategy which emphasises nationalism and unilateral action. He consistently contrasted his managerial skills with the ineptitude of career politicians and promised to make the best deals for America. However, the initial year of the Trump presidency has not generated the much-anticipated foreign policy successes and confusion and uncertainty have surfaced regarding America’s global leadership. Many of the difficulties the administration has faced in implementing its foreign policy strategy stem from the President’s unique management style. The current paper analyses the challenges Trump has encountered in employing his corporate management style in the Presidency and the effects it has had on America’s ability to lead the liberal international order. Notoriously, the fiscal architecture of the common currency was flawed in several respects from the very start. Less well known are the flaws in the political architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union. This is characterised by a system of incentives that thwarts all efforts towards an overall macro-economic stabilisation of the Eurozone. There are two possible solutions to this problem: one is the political union, to be brought about by means of an additional transfer of economic and fiscal sovereignty and a corresponding mechanism of political legitimacy, or different fiscal rules within the current structure of political governance. The essay expounds upon these two options while taking into account the European Commission’s most recent reform proposals. It furthermore assesses the hurdles that the latter will have to overcome against the background of the preferences of the most influential Member States. Most democratic transitions have demonstrated how it is possible to move from an authoritarian starting point towards an ongoing state of compromise. The Kingdom of Bhutan, a small state bordering India and China and located deep within the Himalayan Mountains, stands as an illustrative case of that paradigm. Not only has that country recently welcomed extensive democratic practices after a century of monarchical rule, but more interestingly, it did so by royal decree. This unusual top-down transition saw the ruling monarch effectively “enforcing” democracy onto the people rather than the opposite, which defied the customary paradigm of democratisation. Nonetheless, Bhutan’s process of democratisation has been hampered at an initial stage because most Bhutanese citizens remained satisfied with the previous monarchical regime. As such, the purpose of the communication is to enlighten the reader with the features of Bhutanese democracy and its preceding process of democratisation, while providing a possible answer on whether there is a common pattern in the transitional process of authoritarianism to democracy. In order to do so, the article firstly looks at Bhutan’s modern political history; secondly, it analyses the idiosyncrasies of Bhutanese democracy; and thirdly, it shows how the historical, religious and social background of Bhutan has led to a peculiar process of democratic consolidation. The present paper aims to raise important elements of Marxism for a critique of international politics and apply them to a study on the international superstructure. This paper is divided into 4 fundamental items: (I) a discussion on the necessary elements to an international relations theory (the concept of State and war); (II) a discussion on the Marxist criticism of classical traditions in International Relations; (III) the construction of an arena for analysis from the Marxist point of view; (IV) an essay on international institutions and globalization, based on the elements articulated throughout the paper. The interpretation of the sovereignty concept has undergone mutations throughout its history that has also accompanied the genesis and evolution of the nation-state. Today, the understanding of it is relatively different from that which was theorized by Bodin. Due to changes in the international order with the proliferation of supranational and supra-state organizations, globalization of the economy, politics and markets, as well as international law, their absolute meaning has also become questionable. It is in this context that Rawls, following the transformations that took place at the political level but above all in international law, defends a sovereignty limited by a People’s Law for the societies that make up the Society of Peoples. This article aims to demonstrate that the idea of a World Society of Peoples (liberal or decent), leads Rawls back to the idea of popular sovereignty in a perspective very similar to that defended by Rousseau. Given recent changes in the political leadership of Muslim societies, it can be difficult to follow who got which hand on women’s issues, let alone just how women’s issues figure in political speeches from the Liberal to the most conservative. Meanwhile, when it comes to the laws and regulations on women’s issues, not much has been done to empower women to decide what is best for them. It’s only an appealing matter to discuss more or less, depending on the political need, while recent reports describe the city of Cairo as one of the least safe cities for women. Following the Arab Spring, which pushed many to reconsider the fight for democracy and human rights, socio-economic conditions have been worsening for both men and women, with those in the latter category suffering the most. We may find it challenging to track improvements in the area of women’s rights as long as the same old-new religious speech calls on women to keep their faith and patience for God’s sake, for a better future for their body, and for the dignity of their mind and soul. This paper discusses the current status of women’s rights in Muslim societies and how policy processes are informed by religious justification. This article analyzes speeches of tenure of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil made between 2003 and 2016, in the inaugural speech of former Minister José Serra. Using discourse analysis, the paper analyzes guidelines of the Foreign Policy of the Lula, Dilma and Temer governments. The paper seeks to corroborate the thesis that in the government of the Workers’ Party (PT) the guidelines of the Brazilian foreign policy emphasize global South relations, while in the government of the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) these guidelines prioritize relations with the centers of capitalism. To this end, we used the content analysis method proposed by Bardin (1977) and the software IRAMUTEQ. Water is an increasingly scarce resource. One of the most noteworthy discursive features of the last decades has been a growing awareness of water-related issues as a critically important component for regional stability. This situation helps to explain why, in many cases, water management involves political, economic, social, environmental and even military issues. But, in what intensity? This article analyzes the cases of Southern Africa and the Jordan River Basin due to their prevailing condition of water scarcity. In order to verify the role developed by the mechanisms of governance in accommodating the interests of the riparian states, the Hydropolitical Complexes Theory was applied. Inferences demonstrated a trend towards cooperation in Southern Africa that is due to the successful institutionalization of management mechanisms capable of minimizing potential for conflicts. On the other hand, in the Jordan Basin, the struggle to control water resources has been a significant factor in sustaining tension among riparian countries. Understanding the concept of democracy in its totality today is a rather complex task, given the dimensions and variation of political societies. Revisiting the theoretical thinking of the ancients may be an interesting exercise for comparative examination of what and how Aristotelian thought is present in the modern conception of democracy. The result of this comparative exercise points to the existence of a strong analogy between the old and modern conception of democracy as a mode of government for a political society. This article discusses discursive strategies employed by Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán that embody the securitization of migration through mnemonic elements, namely, memory and trauma. The discursive policies that have been identified were produced in the context of the European refugee crisis. Literature in International Relations has debated the discursive and non-discursive practices that result in the securitization of migration, yet there exist few studies that articulate the junctions of (in)security, migration, memory and trauma. This article draws from Critical Discourse Analysis and critical geopolitics to discuss how political discourse can frame migration from a security perspective through the use of mnemonic arguments. Textual categories corresponding to intersections of migration, (in) security, memory and trauma were identified. I argue that linking migration to these topics has allowed Orbán to (re)construct Hungarian ontological location, relocating the country in relation to Central and Eastern Europe and placing it within the arena of Russian influence.\n",

      "62 Entropy based image thresholding methods are widely adopted for multilevel image segmentation. Bilevel thresholding partitions an image into two classes, whereas multilevel thresholding partitions an image into multiple classes depending upon thresholding level . The automatic selection of optimal threshold is often treated as an optimization problem. This paper contributes to novel thresholding method, that is based on entropy of fuzzy c partition and gravitational search algorithm (GSA). Experiments have been evaluated on the different test images and results were assessed by entropy, stability, computation time and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). The analysis of results conveys that the GSA outperform particle swarm optimization (PSO). Workflow scheduling is solved using heuristics and meta heuristics. Heuristics are problem-dependent techniques. Meta heuristics are general purpose method of solving different types of problem. It can be single objective or multiple objectives. This paper focuses on our proposed algorithm named as Double Hybrid NSGA-II Algorithm (DHNSGA-II) that improves up the convergence of the NSGA-II algorithm by employing Pre-selection and Memetic algorithms. DHNSGA-II does hybridization at two levels. At the first level, it uses Pre-selection operator and the second level it uses Memetic algorithm. Pre-selection operator seeds the DHNSGA-II with the previously generated solutions. Memetic algorithm improves the current population using multi-objective local search. Apart from DHSNGA-II we introduced an approach to rank the Pareto frontiers because Pareto frontier has many solutions; it is nearly impossible to choose the best solution. The experimental result reveals that the proposed approach in this research performs well in optimizing the workflow scheduling jobs. This paper describes the preliminary results from the development of an IP-based multimedia gateway, using free software resources, to the identification, classification and forwarding of different traffic flows (elastic, more sensitive to packet loss, and stream, more sensitive to communication delays), both with pre-defined traffic profiles. The multimedia gateway performs the traffic selection by inspecting the ToS field of the IPv4 header and the TC field of the IPv6 header, taken as DSCP and ECN. The multimedia traffic corresponding to audio, voice, video and data services are provided by our multimedia traffic generator, which generates traffic according to given distributions. Our tests show that the functional mechanisms of the multimedia gateway are valid and that it can be used as an additional tool for the study and performance evaluation of wireless and wired multimedia networks. Views and viewpoints are concepts usually adopted in an important number of works in software engineering in different domains, like in requirements specification, system modeling, system implementation, and mainly in software architectures. This paper presents a survey about the use of viewpoints in these different domains, and leads a comparative synthesis between different approaches in order to induce their limitations. Also, it briefly presents the main characteristics of our views based approach MoVAL that solves two kinds of problems during view-based software development: the stakeholders\\' communication complexity and the lack of an architecture definition process guiding architect during architecture construction. Distance measures play an important role in cluster analysis. There is no single distance measure that best fits for all types of the clustering problems. So, it is important to find set of distance measures for different clustering techniques on datasets that yields optimal results. In this paper, an attempt has been made to evaluate ten different distance measures on eight clustering techniques. The quality of the distance measures has been computed on basis of three factors: accuracy, inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances. The performance of clustering algorithms on different distance measures has been evaluated on three artificial and six real life datasets. The experimental results reveal that the performance and quality of different distance measures vary with the nature of data as well as clustering techniques. Hence choice of distance measure must be done on basis of dataset and clustering technique. This paper presents an evaluation of different routing algorithms employed in a logical layer peer-to-peer (P2P). The adopted model uses a Metascheduler that provides quality of services (QoS) in Cloud Computing. The experiments show the response times and the variation between the results of different tests. The various routing algorithms has given the influence of the number of users and type of requested services and how these factors interact between themselves. Based on specific objectives, the results allow determining the impact of the utilization of P2P approaches (Pastry and Chord) by a metascheduler on the search and discovery of services regarding the way the QoS is performed. The population increase and the growth of buying power of home appliances cause the need of electricity power to increase every year in Brazil. Electric dispatch is defined as the attribution of operational values to each generation unit inside a power plant, given some criteria to be fulfilled. In this context, an optimal dispatch schedule for hydroelectric units in energy plants provides a greater amount of energy to be generated with less consumption of water. This paper presents an optimization solution to solve this problem for an actual plant, using Genetic Algorithms. The underlying mathematical modeling is described in details and practical validation of the proposed approach is performed through simulation experiments. In the case study, results are analysed and compared to the actual system running in a real world plant. Finally, the generality of the proposed approach is discussed and possibilities of its use to solve the same problem to other hydroelectric plants are presented. The World Wide Web has been enhanced with many types of online services such as banking access, e-commerce, e-health, e-learning, etc. This variety of services, distributed around the world, can be accessed from any place at anytime. However, in some situations a user may face difficulties in the use of the traditional mouse and keyboard input devices to search and access services through the Web. In this paper we propose the use of multimodal interfaces for the discovery and invocation of Web Services. Our approach, called Multimodal Interface for Discovery and Invocation of Web Services (MIDIWS), transforms users requests made in XHTML + VoiceXML into requests specified as SOAP messages. These requests are sent to a UDDI repository which returns a service or a set of services also by means of SOAP messages. These messages are transformed back into XHTML + VoiceXML and, then, presented to the user. Tree automata are widely used in applications such as XML document manipulation, natural language processing, and formal verification. We propose in this paper to generate decision trees classifiers using tree automata models. Mainly, two objectives are : 1) fitting these methods in a formal frame and, 2) using tree automata in modeling decision trees and classifying heterogeneous information sources. Specifically, the size of a decision tree is reduced by a post-pruning procedure: a given decision tree is converted into a tree automaton and then the latter is simplified by eliminating useless states and non-determinism. We report some empirical experiments on real-world datasets. Secure group communication systems typically rely on a group key, a secret shared by all members of the group. Confidentiality is provided by encrypting all messages with the group key. Meanwhile, some of the associated problems with securing group communications are rekeying when membership changes and multiple sub-group key storage by users. In this paper, an Efficient Broadcast Encryption Scheme (EBES) which uses key encapsulation mechanism was designed to eliminate these problems. Symmetric cryptosystem (AES 128), Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem in prime order Galois Field GFp simulated over the Elgammal Cryptosystem (EC-ELGAMAL) and the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) are the major components of our solution. The design also introduced the concept of mutual authentication into group communications using cryptographic keys. The authentication was performed smoothly using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Scheme (ECDSS). The security of our solution was formally proven by reduction to the security of EC-ELGAMAL cryptosystem, which is based on Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). This paper is concluded with a set of experimental results that support our research. Software component reuse is the key to significant gains in productivity. However, the major problem is the lack of identifying and developing potentially reusable components. This paper concentrates on our approach to the development of reusable software components. A prototype tool has been developed, known as the Reuse Assessor and Improver System (RAIS) which can interactively identify, analyse, assess, and modify abstractions, attributes and architectures that support reuse. Practical and objective reuse guidelines are used to represent reuse knowledge and to do domain analysis. It takes existing components, provides systematic reuse assessment which is based on reuse advice and analysis, and produces components that are improved for reuse. Our work on guidelines has been extended to a large scale industrial application.\n",
      "63 Abstract: Although initially developed for large corporations, economic value added (EVA) is a potential performance indicator to be used in small businesses (SME)s. EVA is calculated based on the cost of capital (equity and third party´s capital). Usually, the cost of equity capital is estimated using the classical Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), whose parameters are estimated by market data. In general, the CAPM becomes impracticable in SMEs due to the scarcity or absence of stocks traded on the stock exchange. As literature presents some alternative methods to calculate the cost of equity for small private companies, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the alternative method proposed by Boudreaux et al. (2011) compared to the classical CAPM, when both methods are used to calculate the EVA indicator. From a sample composed of 34 companies listed on the Brazilian stock exchange (B3), the results show that the method is useful for estimating the cost of equity capital in the calculation of the EVA indicator.\\nKeywords: Small businesses; SME; EVA indicator; Cost of equity capital; Cost of capital; Capital Asset Pricing Model; CAPM. Article based on information collected regarding the adopting of Lean Manufacturing in a segment previously unknown to this implementation, which is dedicated to strategies of a company. The differentiation came up for the need of market spread and growth of the features that the world of technology demands, and how that area is focused on providing services to a technology company, created the need for implementation of this model.\n",

      "65 Introduction: Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) occurs due to the destruction of red blood cells, which the most common cause is rhesus incompatibility. This study aims to present a case of Rhesus incompatibility in pregnancy without a clinically significant effect on the baby.\\nCase: A-38-years-old Indonesian woman with gravida 4 para 3 (G4P3A0), 32 weeks of gestational age came to the emergency department due to vaginal bleeding. On blood typing, she had an A-negative (A-) blood type. Her husband and all three of their children had O-positive (O+) blood type. The patient underwent a cesarean section due to recurrent antepartum hemorrhage following the total placenta previa. She gave birth to a baby girl, weighed 2,220 grams with an A-positive blood type. The hemoglobin level was 14.6 g/dL without any sign of neonatal jaundice during the first 24 hours of life.\\nConclusion: Our case illustrates a woman who did not show any sign of clinically Rhesus antigen alloimmunization. Low immunogenicity and dose-dependent response to a low fetal blood volume exposure might explain this phenomenon. Introduction:&nbsp;Teratoma is an embryonal neoplasm consisted of 3 germinal layers. Teratoma usually arises along the line of embryonic cleft and sinus closure formed by the fusion of skin during the embryonic development. In this case report, we present a case of fetal Teratoma on the vulval region, a very rare variant of the disease.\\nCase:&nbsp;A 28-year-old woman came for a routine check-up for her first pregnancy at her 26th&nbsp;weeks of gestational age. On ultrasound examination, a mass was found around the fetal vulva. There was no mass or malformations on other body parts. Placenta and the amount of amniotic fluid were normal. History of congenital anomaly in the family was denied. The patient then gave birth to a female baby at 38 weeks of gestational age without any complication. The baby was healthy, 2650 gram in weight, 50 cm in length, with good APGAR Score (8-10). On the baby left labia, there was a mass measured 5 cm x 4 cm x 3 cm, with slight discoloration. We recommend an early tumor excision to prevent unnecessary complication such as malignant transformation. Although at the time of writing, the patient still waiting for the schedule to remove the tumor due to a non-medical factor.\\nConclusion:&nbsp;Congenital Teratoma in the vulvar region was a very rare event. First-line therapy is early tumor excision and usually carries an excellent prognosis. Introduction: Polyhydramnios is a condition in which the amount of amniotic fluid increases more than 2 litres. The causes of polyhydramnios are multifactorial, and most are idiopathic. Here we report challenging management of polyhydramnios case without apparent risk factors.\\nCase: A 30-year-old woman G2P1001, 27-28 weeks of gestational age referred due to our tertiary health care center due to polyhydramnios. The patient chief complaint was progressively enlarged abdomen since a month ago. Her previous pregnancy, medical history and family history were unremarkable. The obstetric examination reflects the size of uterus equivalent to 36 weeks of gestational age. The fetomaternal ultrasound reveals a life, single fetus with normal heart rate and fetal movement, estimated fetal weight about 1057 grams, placenta corpus posterior grade I, Maximum Vertical Pocket 22.83 cm, no major congenital abnormalities were visible and bladder appears filled. Laboratory tests revealed blood glucose levels 90 mg/dl, Hb-A1c 5.2%, Ureum 27.30 mg/dl, Creatinine 3.39 mg/dl, and numerous leukocytes on urine sediment. Amnioreduction and fetal pulmonary maturation were conducted by Dexamethason protocol. Amnioreduction yield 1500 ml of clear, yellowish amniotic fluid. Regarding abnormality in renal function, diagnosis of Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease (ACKD were established by Internal medicine department, and the patients were given a series of ceftriaxone injection. The patient was planned for indomethacin therapy; however, Indomethacin was not available in Bali.\\nConclusion: Careful search for causes both from the maternal factor and fetal abnormalities can help to determine the prognosis of pregnancy. Ideally, amnioreduction, coupled with indomethacin therapy, are needed to reduce amniotic fluid, and serial monitoring of the amniotic fluid volume is required to prevent preterm labor. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with a covalently closed circular structure that present in a variety of organisms. The circRNAs are more stable and durable than linear RNAs due to incompatibility with the RNases. Recent studies have shown that circRNAs are expressed differently at the mother-fetal interface of women with preeclampsia compared to women with normal pregnancy. Although the evidence showed that circRNAs mediate various pathological processes in pregnancy, the mechanism of action is still unclear. In this paper, we provide a highlight of the current state of knowledge about circRNAs, its relation to preeclampsia, and the potential applications as preeclampsia biomarkers. Introduction: This study describes the effect of antibiotic therapy on salivary catalase kinetic parameters (CAT) at neonatal at risk of sepsis.\\nMethods: Study is conducted from February – June 2015. Salivary samples are obtained from 20 neonates (5 normal-healthy neonates and 15 neonates at risk of sepsis) at Ulin General Hospital, Banjarmasin, Indonesia. The samples were placed in four different groups: P0 as control group (saliva + hydrogen peroxide/H2O2), P1 (saliva + 2 mg Ampicillin + H2O2), P2 (saliva + 0.2 mg Gentamicin + H2O2), P3 (saliva + 2 mg Ampicillin + 0.2 mg Gentamicin + H2O2). The solution is incubated at 37oC and 40oC before catalase (CAT) activity is measured. Catalase activity is measured by using a spectrophotometer at 240 nm. Kinetic parameters are measured at different concentrations of H2O2 and temperature. Kinetic parameters are represented by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the maximum reaction speed (Vmax) obtained through the Lineweaver-Burk curve plot.\\nResults: The Km of Catalase on the saliva of neonates at risk of sepsis treated with antibiotics (4.37, 1.84, 0.12, and 0.23, 3.74, 1.5, for P1, P2, P3 respectively) was lower than the control group (17.61 and 12.54), both at 37ºC and 40ºC. Similarly, Vmax of the neonates at risk of sepsis treated with antibiotics (0.46, 0.34, 0.04 and 0.07, 0.20, 0.24) was lower than the control group (1.47 and 0.53) at 37ºC and 40ºC.\\nConclusion: The study shows that the Catalase activity at the saliva of newborns at risk of sepsis treated with antibiotic was lower than the control group. Introduction. Sepsis represents a severe problem for newborns. The relatively high incidence rate of 1 to 10 cases per 1000 live births, with even higher rates in low-birth-weight neonates. Given its high incidence, identifying markers to optimize the early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions is highly desirable. This study investigates three oxidative markers taken from saliva, methylglyoxal (MG), Thiocyanate (SCN-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as early-onset neonatal sepsis markers.\\nMethods. This study was conducted from June to August 2014, and saliva specimens were taken from 30 newborns of mothers with one major risk factor or two minor risk factors (case group) and 30 healthy newborns for the control group. Saliva levels of MG were determined by calculating the percentage of MG absorbance compared with the carbonyl compounds. Data were analyzed by using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Student\\'s t test.\\nResults. We found a significant increase of SCN-, and MG level case group (28.91 mmol and 0.01%, respectively) compared to the control group (19.49 mmol and 0.005%, respectively) p-value = 0.03. In contrast, the H2O2 in the case group (32.56 mmol) was lower than the control group (37.47 mmol), with a p-value = 0.04.\\nConclusion. We found the increased levels of SCN–, MG and the decreased levels of H2O2 in neonates\\' saliva with the risk of sepsis. MG measurements as a routine diagnostic for suspected sepsis should be taken into consideration. Introduction. Fetal Acrania is a rare fetal malformation characterized by the complete or partial absence of a skull covering the fetal brain. In the absence of a hard covering of the soft brain tissue, Acrania is known as a universally lethal malformation.&nbsp; Here we present a Fetal Acrania case detected by sonographic examination at our Center.\\nCase Description. A 36 years old female was referred to the obstetric department to undergo an in-depth sonographic evaluation as a previous examination reveals a potential congenital fetal anomaly. Our sonographic evaluation revealed a singleton, live fetus, 12 weeks gestational age in cephalic presentation and longitudinal lie. One obvious malformation was a well-formed fetal brain without the surrounding cranium (Acrania). The absence of cranium was the main and only malformation. The absence of cranium was evident as the fetal brain was easily compressed on probe pressure, and the brain appeared like floating in the amniotic fluid over the base of the skull. Therapeutic abortion was carried out. The termination was conducted by administering four tablets of 200 mcg misoprostol sublingually and repeated 24 hours later. No adverse reaction or complication on termination. The aborted fetal examination confirmed the lack of fetal cranium.\\nConclusion. Although seemingly obvious, the first-trimester diagnosis of fetal Acrania must be made with caution as the fetal cranium is not fully calcified before 10- 11 weeks. As Acrania is a universally lethal malformation, therapeutic abortion is indicated. Introduction. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected every part of the population, including pregnant mothers, breastfeeding mothers, and infants. There is an inadequate comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential as of now. As expected, it will result in anxiety among the public, including a specific issue such as breastfeeding practice for the suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus infection. This study aimed to assess whether such anxiety was present in a population of patients that routinely visit Kasih Medika clinic.\\nMethods. This is a simple study conducted on August 5-10, 2020. This study used a questionnaire instrument with samples of pregnant and postpartum mothers. The questionnaire includes a question regarding the anxiety surrounding breastfeeding, visiting the clinic and their everyday activity.\\nResults. We reported that COVID-19 has an impact on the breastfeeding plans from the respondent\\'s questionnaire. All respondents felt anxious about COVID-19, although only 18% of patients reduce their routine visits to Kasih Medika, while the rest keep visiting as scheduled. Eighty-six percent of respondents restricted their outdoor activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic causes 27% of the respondents to feel afraid of their breastfeeding plans. However, in the primigravida population, 45.45% of respondents were afraid of their breastfeeding plans. Meanwhile, in the multigravida and postpartum respondents, 90.90%&nbsp; were not afraid about their breastfeeding plans during the COVID-19 period.\\nConclusion. COVID-19 pandemic brings a certain degree of anxiety to the mothers, including anxiety of safety during breastfeeding practice. Despite the risk of transmission, breastfeeding has more benefits than disadvantages. Breastfeeding makes the infant have a good immune system, which prevents any disease, including COVID-19. Breastfeeding during the COVID-19 is still recommended under health protocol. Background: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with complex pathogenesis with broad clinical manifestations, more common in women of reproductive age between 15-44 years, so there is an increased incidence in pregnancies.\\nMethods: This study was a descriptive observational study with a cross-sectional design using medical records of patients in Dr. Mohammad Hoesin Hospital Palembang from January 2018-June 2020. Sampling was carried out by total sampling with the presentation of data in tables and narratives. Data processing was performed using SPSS 25.\\nResults: There were 1,039 pregnancies in January 2018-June 2020 with 26 pregnancies with SLE and 8 patients (30.8%) of moderate degree SLE. The demographic characteristics were 26-30 age range (30.8%), high school education status (53.8%), the number of pregnancies 2-3 times (53.8%), the number of primiparous births (46.2%), and the number of miscarriages was never experienced (65.4%). Based on clinical signs and symptoms, malaise (15.4%), malar rash, photosensitivity spots and alopecia (15.4%), inflammatory arthritis (46.2%), lupus nephritis (11.5%), abdominal pain ( 34.6%), lymphadenopathy (3.8%), anemia or lymphopenia (15.4%), and cephalgia (7.7%). Meanwhile, the parameter of diagnosis was lymphopenia (15.4%), eGFR stage 1 (34.6%), proteinuria or proteinuria and cylindruria (11.5%), ANA test (+) (19.2%), anti-dsDNA test (+) (19.2%), and the complement test decreased (7.7%). Pregnancy outcomes were found to have intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (19.2%) and preeclampsia and IUGR (11.5%).\\nConclusion: From the 26 pregnant patients with SLE, most were found with a moderate degree. Most demographic characteristics were age range 26-30 years old, high school education status, number of pregnancies\n",

Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Maulana Malik Ibrahim of Malang has Academic Information System (SIAKAD) and E-Learning. They are used to manage the entire academic process in UIN of Malang. SIAKAD has been accessible via the internet and always updated. This is different from E-Learning, which is online and has not updated. The existing E-Learning data is entered manually and not scheduled automatically. In addition, the data entry are very complex, so that management becomes difficult. Data integration between SIAKAD and E-Learning should be created to solve the problem. The REST (REpresentational State Transfer) web service is a great choice of method to integrate many systems and databases. The result shows that data integration between SIAKAD and E-Learning in UIN of Malang can be created using REST web service. The SIAKAD data will be the same as the E-Learning data because the data is already synchronized. The data are data of students, lecturers, faculties, departements and courses. REST web services can be executed on a scheduling automatically using crontab application on Linux or FreeBSD operating system, so the data is no longer entered manually.

Frisian Flag Indonesia called QIN (Quality Information Notice). At present, to save inappropriate product findings, PT YCH Indonesia uses physical files stored in an ordner. In this way the possibility of loss of documents or files becomes larger. From these problems raises the idea to create a system of QIN (Quality Information Notice) application that serves to store data findings that are not appropriate product when the inbound process and the findings of broken products in the locator. The method used is waterfall method using web-based programming language in order to be accessible by users from various warehouses branch. Supported with the availability of local internet network (intranet) within the company. Students graduating late from college are a common problem in universities. The study of students at universities is generally designed to be completed in 3.5 to 4 years. If a student has not graduated past that time, he is considered late in completing his education. Lambung Mangkurat University, as the oldest university in Kalimantan, also experienced these problems. Therefore, an early warning system was build to predict students\\' possibility of being late in completing their studies. This study uses a sample of students from the Faculty of Engineering, the University of Lambung Mangkurat, to predict students who will be late graduating from Lambung Mangkurat University since semester 5. This system was to develop using a model built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Model training conducted using 755 data from Lambung Mangkurat University Faculty of Engineering students from 2010 to 2014. Then, the performance of the model tested using 234 student data from 2015 and 2016. The parameters used were the number of credits, gender, GPA on semester 1 to 4, and study programs. The test results show that the model has good performance to predict students who will be late in completing their studies with 88.2% accuracy. Network automation is a solution in implementing some complicated or repetitive work. The standard configuration method on network devices performs by entering a network device. That looks easy to configure one or two network devices. that will look not very easy if one must configure many network devices such as routers and servers. Ansible served as a network automation tool on a large and small scale on a computer network, and Ansible served to simplify configuring network devices. The library in its management is still not well-database so that the data managers carried out at the library of SMPIT AL Mustopa have not been systematic and still use the old-fashioned way of recording student data so that it results in frequent data collection errors that include lending, book returns, delays and fines. With the old way system causes users to spend a long time to borrow books. So this research will complement those shortcomings by making a computerized Library System using the PHP programming language and Mysql database and so use the Prototype model test technique. Application development uses a prototype approach that can help customers and system developers explore the specifications of the system requirements as desired by the customer. The findings of this study are computerized web-based library systems between book data and users so as to facilitate the performance of agencies in providing information, processing data and computerized library reporting that is easily maintained and developed and helps minimize errors in processing library data Professional Certification Authority (LSP) is an implementing agency for certification activities that are licensed by the Indonesian Professional Certification Authority (BNSP). Based on BNSP, in August 2019 there were 28,135 assessors, 120 master assessors, 13,559 competency test sites. In terms of the type of certification, there are three types of LSP, namely LSP P1, which amounts to 1,174, LSP P2 totalling 74, and LSP P3 totalling 280. LSP FTI UNISKA Banjarmasin is one of 56 LSP types P1 Universities spread throughout Indonesia. At present, the administration at LSP FTI UNISKA Banjarmasin, starting from registering participants to conducting competency tests, remains still fulfilled manually. Hence, administrators and directors often feel problems in taking out the certification process. Through this research, a web-based LSP administration application designed by collecting data using observation, interviews, and documentation studies, then information systems designed using the waterfall method. From the results of the research succeeded in designing an information system that can help the data administration process of competency test participants, scheduling, administration as well as making the competency test results report. Anti Forensic Techniques aim to complicate the process of investigating a crime. Hiding an SMS message with the aim or support of a crime can be categorized as an Anti Forensic technique. On smartphones with the MIUI operating system, it is equipped with features to block an SMS message and even hide an SMS message. The existence of a feature to hide SMS messages will complicate the investigation process if this feature uses to support crime. This research proposes a forensic analysis method to detect hidden SMS messages using open-source software. Differences in the process of retrieving digital evidence will affect the results of forensic analysis. So in this research to compare the results of the analysis of two digital forensic software to detect hidden messages.\n",
      "67 Employing a theoretical perspective from the critical sociology of education, this article identifies a curriculum problem in human rights education (HRE) in schools and suggests strategies to solve it. The main problem is HRE’s lack of an episteme—a disciplinary structure created in specialist communities—and, related to this, the flight of scholars from the field of curriculum practice, redefining it away from subject matter. A more robust HRE in schools will require not only advocacy but a curriculum, one that teachers can adapt to local needs, constraints, and students. Knowledge matters. If knowledge work of this sort is missing from HRE then it is difficult to claim that HRE has a social justice mission. Human Rights Education (HRE) emphasises the significance of children learning about, through and for human rights through their lived experiences. Such experiential learning, however, is often limited to instances of enjoyment of rights and disregards experiences of injustice, exclusion or discrimination.&nbsp; By neglecting the ‘negative’ experiences, including breaches of their human rights, HRE fails in one of its fundamental aims: empowering individuals to exercise their rights and to respect and uphold the rights of others.&nbsp; Drawing on a range of legal sources, this article identifies a number of violations of the human rights of children in schools, categorised under five themes: access to school; the curriculum; testing and assessment; discipline; and respect for children’s views. It argues that for HRE to achieve its core purpose, it must enable children to identify and challenge breaches of rights in school and elsewhere. To do so, knowledge of law, both domestic and international, has a fundamental role to play. This article contributes to the debate on human rights education in diverse societies. It is concerned with the relationship between participation and the co-construction of national belonging. Our data consists of 289 pupil texts and 33 focus group discussions in 6 upper secondary schools in Norway. The role of the school in nation-building is well-known, often emphasizing policy documents or curricula. However, it is in the interaction between pupils and their teachers that the production and re-production of the nation occurs. Participatory exercises in our focus groups functioned as pedagogical interventions, helping pupils to reflect on how they understand, discuss and co-construct national belonging. We find that the potential for co-construction of national belonging, through pedagogical interventions, depends on who is acknowledged as a legitimate participant. Notwithstanding power hierarchies, it can be argued that group discussions are concrete ways to help young people in diverse classrooms co-construct national belonging. Using the global discourse of human rights as a basis, the purpose of this article is to analyse how education for citizenship and human rights has been implemented in Spain in recent years. In addition, discourse analysis and the theory of social movements have been used to study the mobilisation that arose against this instruction, showing how the neoconservative Catholic sectors of Spanish society encouraged Catholics to engage in conscientious objection and civil disobedience in order to gradually achieve the removal of Education for Citizenship and Human Rights from Spanish curricula. If human rights education of schoolchildren addresses advocacy at all, it is mostly or exclusively in terms of civic participation, which perhaps includes civil protest. This approach implicitly discourages young people from considering engaging with the courts as an additional or alternative vehicle in seeking a remedy for violations of their fundamental human rights. Human rights education is incomplete when it fails to address the child’s right to legal standing in the effort to seek justice; for instance, as part of a child collective that is significantly adversely and directly impacted by particular government actions. Exemplars of children acquiring legal standing and pursuing their rights through the courts can serve as a useful educational tool in raising awareness of the potential for child public interest advocacy through the courts. One such exemplar, the youth-led class action environmental protection case Juliana et al. v the United States et al., is discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing theoretically on the Didaktik tradition, this paper examines teaching and learning content in teacher-planned human rights education with eleven- year-old pupils in two Swedish classrooms. The results suggest that the principle aim for the teaching and learning of rights is to enable good interactions with other human beings. The findings indicate that teaching content and pupils’ learning outcomes are similar. Four dominant themes are identified in teaching and learning: fundamental democratic values; declarations of (human) rights; bullying and violations; and negative life conditions. Human rights are negatively interpreted, with an emphasis on rights violations and children’s need for protection and support. The paper concludes that human rights education is conflated with democratic education. &nbsp;Although teaching and learning are closely aligned with the fundamental and democratic values stipulated in the Swedish Education Act and the national curriculum, children are not expected to acquire in-depth knowledge about human rights. The paper explores citizenship positions for the Sami as citizen in the overarching policy document for the Norwegian school. Informed by the perspective that policy documents hold discursive productivity in the Foucauldian sense, this document is regarded as vital for locating normative cultural ideals. The analysis points to three discourses: indigeneity, multiculturalism and the common Norwegian cultural heritage perspective. Although the analysis suggests that there is a variety of possible citizenship identity positions, tensions are located in their ontological and epistemological claims regarding what it means to be Sami. The paper argues that indigenous perspectives might both challenge and complement current ideas of citizenship and human rights education. Notably, indigeneity accentuates the tension between universalism and recognition in human rights education. The paper also points to how the curriculum has great ambitions about the possibilities of inclusive practice within an educational system that lacks sufficient competence on Sami culture. Human rights education (HRE) seeks to provide young people with an optimistic sense that we can work towards a more peaceful and socially just world, and that everyone can do something to contribute to securing improvement. But, whilst the academic literature and policy documents frequently position teachers as crucial to promoting human rights and social justice, the literature is also replete with examples of teachers’ conservatism, their compliance in the face of authority and their ignorance. In addition, teachers work in institutions which routinely reproduce inequality and promote a narrow individualistic form of competition. This article explores some of the international research literature relating to the role of the teacher in HRE specifically, and more generally in the related fields of citizenship education and social studies, in order to offer some conceptual tools that might be used to critically interrogate practitioners’ own beliefs and actions.\\n&nbsp;\\n&nbsp; Human rights education (HRE) has been recognised in international educational discourses as a sustainable practice to develop active citizenship and protect human dignity. However, such education has not been fully explored in a broader political context. In addition to contributing to empowering citizens to resist human rights violations, HRE plays several roles in society, contributing to both national identity and international image-building. The article explores possible relations between national identity construction, foreign policy and HRE in Norway through the following research question: What interplay occurs between Norwegian foreign policy and national identity in relation to human rights, and, within this context, what is the role of HRE? The article presents a qualitative analysis of Norwegian policy documents and reports, arguing that HRE is a component of Norwegian national identity as well as political currency in foreign relations.\\n&nbsp; Enhancing young learners’ knowledge about appropriate and inappropriate sexual behaviour is crucial for the protection of children’s rights. This article discusses teachers’ understandings of their practices and approaches to the topic of child sexual abuse in Norwegian upper secondary schools, based on phone interviews with 64 social science teachers. Countering child sexual abuse is a political priority for the Norwegian government, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child acknowledges several state initiatives to counter child sexual abuse through education. Nevertheless, this study finds that teachers do not address this topic adequately, indicating that cultural taboos regarding talking about and thus preventing such abuse, including rape among young peers, still prevail in Norwegian classrooms. Furthermore, emotional obstacles, including concerns about re-traumatising and stigmatising learners, hinder some teachers from addressing this topic thoroughly. Additional explanatory factors include heavy teacher workloads, little preparation in teacher education programmes, insufficient information in textbooks, and an ambiguous national curriculum. Effectively addressing violations of human rights requires dealing with complex, multi-spatial problems involving actors at local, national and international levels. It also calls for a diverse range of inter-disciplinary skills. How can tertiary educators prepare students for such work? This study evaluates the coordinated implementation of human rights simulations at seven Australian universities. Based on quantitative and qualitative survey data from 252 students, we find they report that human rights simulation exercises develop their skills. In particular, students report that they feel better able to analyse and productively respond to human rights violations, and that they have a greater awareness of the inter-disciplinary skills required to do so. Overall, this study finds that simulations are a valid, scalable, classroom-based work integrated learning experience that can be adapted for students at undergraduate and postgraduate level, across a range of disciplines and in both face-to-face and online classes.\n",
      "68 Simulation-based design increasingly replaces traditional experience-based design. This article gives an overview of techniques now used in advanced industry practice, with particular focus on navy applications. The article covers the basics of the techniques, illustrating approaches and state of the art with applications taken from the experience of Germanischer Lloyd. The present work aims to analyze the Brazilian maritime industry. The core of the work is making an analysis of which are the basic elements to insert this system in the national maritime industry and how it is structured nowadays. The focus of the work is to analyze the four larger segments of this industry in Brazil: shipbuilding, construction of off-shore platforms and ship repair. The research included fieldwork in each national shipyard and other actors in the supply chain of that industry, as well as unions and associations. Repairs and changes of steel plates in the structure of the vessels where it is possible to find steels with a high degree of deterioration need reliable welded joints in naval steel of the type ASTM A–131 Gr. A new to old. Due to the fact that the variables associated to the weldability of the materials to be repaired are not known, it is necessary to make a study on the weldability of steel ASTM A131 Gr A, in full penetration seams or junctures, under the various parameters involved in the welding process, to determine the influence of the corroding residues that affect the application of welding compounds through the analysis of the metallurgical reactions of liquid condition in order to select the contributing materials with the alloy elements that are able to prevent these phenomena and to recommend the best practices for the electric arc welding process with tubular electrode with FCAW flux core. Productivity parameters were determined in maintenance works of 16 ships in the slipways of ASTINAVE, a medium-size shipyard at Guayaquil, Ecuador, in the period between April 2008 and January 2009. Typical processes applied during ship maintenance, its units for evaluation and a classification chart are presented. With the registered time (Man-Hour, M-H), mean values, standard deviations and variation coefficients were calculated for each process. Mean value results for each work were: Plating replacement: 0.220 M-H/kg, Hull cleaning: 0.435 M-H/m2-machine, Painting: 0.027 M-H/m2-machine, Cathodic protection: 0.116 M-H/Kg, Thickness measurement: 0.030 M-H/test, Propulsion system: 130.92 M-H/line, Steering system: 54.89 M-H/line, Ship docking/undocking: 43.97 M-H/maneuver, Bottom Valves: 15.83 M-H/#valve, and, Fuel tank cleaning: 0.0093 M-H/gal. An adaptable fuzzy inference technique is being described in order to generate predictive models of the acceleration of the pitching of a high speed vessel, from the data obtained from the web on an experiment conducted by the University of Iowa. The geometry of interest in the experiment is a scale model of the type 1/46.6 of the DTMB model 5415 (DDG-51). The fuzzy algorithm for the generation of the predictive model uses a triangular partition with a 0.5 overlapping and consequents of the Singleton type. The consequents are adjusted in an automatic fashion by using recursive least squares. The algorithm shows a very low computational complexity rate which allows for it to be used for on line identification. This research shows the design and construction of a multi objective optimization support system for decision making, DSS-SCHEDULER, in order to effectively perform naval shipbuilding operations, by managing to have a rational usage, under a limited capacity, of the installed capacity. The system creates the operational plan for the scheduling of operations as well as the allocation of all the resources related to the processes carried out at the plant, and, taking into account all the restrictions this type of service entails, generate a set of optimal solutions in order to comply with the objective functions as planned, such as costs and the promise for delivery dates to support the decision making process in scheduling Cotecmar’s industrial operations. In the summer of 2010, the first ever NSF’s Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) in Colombia was held in Barranquilla and Cartagena. The two-week institute brought together researchers of the Americas to discuss topics related to dynamics and control of manned and unmanned marine vehicles. This paper presents a summary of the program organization and findings, along with lecturer and participant feedback. It is intended to serve as a lead-in to the technical papers by PASI participants contained in this special edition of Ship Science &amp; Technology. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshless, Lagrangian CFD method. SPH often utilizes static virtual particles to correct for integral deficiencies that occur near boundaries. These virtual particles, while useful in most cases, can be difficult to implement for objects which experience large deformations. As an alternative to virtual particles, a repulsive force algorithm is presented which loosely emulates the presence of virtual particles in the SPH momentum equation. The goal is to develop a guidance and navigation algorithm for an AUV to perform high resolution scanning of the constantly changing river bed of the Magdalena River, the main river of Colombia, from the river mouth to a distance of 10 Km upriver, which is considered to be the riskiest section to navigate. Using geometric control we design the required thrust for an under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle to realize the desired mission. Metamodels, also known as surrogate models, can be used in place of computationally expensive simulation models to increase computational efficiency for the purposes of design optimization or design space exploration. Metamodel-based design optimization is especially advantageous for ship design problems that require either computationally expensive simulations or costly physical experiments. In this paper, three metamodeling methods are evaluated with respect to their capabilities for modeling highly nonlinear, multimodal functions with incrementally increasing numbers of independent variables. Methods analyzed include kriging, radial basis functions (RBF), and support vector regression (SVR). Each metamodeling technique is used to model a set of single-output functions with dimensionality ranging from one to ten independent variables and modality ranging from one to twenty local maxima. The number of points used to train the models is increased until a predetermined error threshold is met. Results show that each of the three methods has its own distinct advantages. Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) can be utilized to perform difficult tasks in cluttered environments such as harbor and port protection. However, since UUVs have nonlinear and highly coupled dynamics, motion planning and control can be difficult when completing complex tasks. Introducing models into the motion planning process can produce paths the vehicle can feasibly traverse. As a result, Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC) is proposed to simultaneously generate control inputs and system trajectories for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The algorithm combines the benefits of sampling-based motion planning with model predictive control (MPC) while avoiding some of the major pitfalls facing both traditional sampling-based planning algorithms and traditional MPC. The method is based on sampling (i.e., discretizing) the input space at each sample period and implementing a goal-directed optimization (e.g., A*) in place of standard numerical optimization. This formulation of MPC readily applies to nonlinear systems and avoids the local minima which can cause a vehicle to become immobilized behind obstacles. The SBMPC algorithm is applied to an AUV in a 2D cluttered environment and an AUV in a common local minima problem. The algorithm is then used on a full kinematic model to demonstrate the benefits.\n",
      "69 The gigamaps relating full-scale prototypes series in this article are synthesising a work developed within the framework of Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance (SAAP) research by design field. Gigamapping serves as a tool for complexity co-designing through relations mapping and has no strict recipe (Sevaldson, 2018b). It is project and participation specific. The particularity of SAAP is that it develops theories and methods through experimental practice. SAAP involves Time-Based Eco-Systemic Co-Design that is performed by both living and non-living agents. Gigamapping is central to SAAP because it is a tool that relates the complexity within collaborative design-research processes and its co-performances. It maps and generates their relations, meaning environmental, societal and cultural aspects and processes across past, current and future habitats and edible landscapes of and across different species and other agencies involved. SAAP’s ambition is to co- and re- design these complexities. Thus, SAAP is based in full-scale prototyping related with gigamapping, both placed into ‘real life’ environments, the “real life co-design laboratories” (Author, Pánek, &amp; Pánková, 2018). SAAP is therefore considering gigamaps as well as the full-scale prototypes as ”prototypical urban interventions” that can drive extensive generative agencies across various communities (Doherty, 2005) and agents; and while doing that, across much larger systems, introducing the necessary shift towards Post-Anthropocene of bio-climatic layers of cultural landscapes, their territories and life-cycles. Creative communities are grassroots, bottom-up initiatives of people who through their diffuse design capacity propose new, desirable service futures that address the problems of everyday life. These creative communities exist within a transition from modernity towards sustainment, their adversarial character embodies alternative values such as conviviality, solidarity, openness and shift the focus from growth to flourishing. The sociotechnical system that is a creative community creating social innovation faces constant threats due to the collapse of traditional support structures and their disruptive, adversarial character and so, identifying strategies to increase its resilience is necessary. We turn to nature for inspiration and mentoring. Biomimisis is a framework that designs solutions inspired by biological systems. We argue that permaculture, provides an interesting direction for the development and research in the context of social innovation. The creative process of Sustainable Product + Service Systems (PSSs) that involve a variety of social, economic and environmental elements is a very complex process that can be characterized as a wicked problem. The following study highlights that, currently, the tools used in PSS assist in the system design process but often explore the design process intuitively based on the designer’s experience. When dealing with complex problems it is important to use a more structured design approach, which involves multidisciplinary teams to explore systematic design techniques. In this sense, a method recognized to assist in the process of creating complex systems is the heuristic. The use of heuristics is considered a cognitive strategy that not only accelerates the creative process, but also generates solutions, regardless of spontaneous creativity. In this article, an analysis of the creative potential of heuristics was carried out with the blueprint tool. The research method used included an unsystematic theoretical survey, followed by an exploratory case study. Therefore, it is intended to contribute to the detection of emphases and gaps in the literature and demonstrate through practical application, the interaction of designers with heuristic principles in the creation process of PSSs. The textile system is one of the most influential production activities at a global level from an environmental point of view, both in relation to the processes that characterize the supply chain and in relation to pre and post-consumer waste. It produces million tons of global greenhouse gas emissions per year and it consumes millions of litres of water; it uses million tons of chemical products. Furthermore, millions of tons of special textile wastes are yearly landfilled in upstream process as well as in downstream process. Less of 1% of materials used to produce clothes becomes part of a closed-loop recycling and less of 2% are recycled in other industrial activities. Changing the textile industrial linear model in a circular one according to Systemic Design principles is advisable, starting from wastes and by-products. As proved in the working paper wastes, due to their properties, can assumed as inputs of new production systems. Particularly the scientific contribution deals with some research activities carried out within a project titled EDILTEX - Innovation for reusing in textile companies. The achievements are described, showing that construction and fashion are fields only apparently far from each other. They can - on the contrary - developing powerful synergies and products with interesting technological and physical performances. The principles of sustainability and social design have been widely adopted to develop new models of community practice, engagement and innovation. Considering the growing interest of social practices and sustainable models, systems thinking provides an opportunity to further frame and organise various design activities to develop a deeper understanding of the spaces of impact through social innovation. This paper examines the practices of existing social enterprise models and the complexities involved in implementing new structures for community involvement through co-creation, co-design and facilitation. Cybernetics, as a way of looking at and engaging with systems, is discussed to position the role of the designer. Using mapping as a visualisation tool and conversational activity, case-studies are evaluated to provide a broad framework of bottom-up systems thinking through participatory methods to enhance social and cultural values. Systems theory and its guidelines - systems thinking - have been promoted as the most relevant practice for raising social awareness about interconnected complex systems. Systemic Design intends to develop methodologies and approaches that help to integrate systems thinking with design towards sustainability at the environmental, social and economic levels. Based on the Hall of the Future requalification project, designed with the Chamber of Commerce of Milan, this essay describes a Systemic Research project with a focus on the use of a Co-Design approach within the process. Moreover, it illustrates an established relationship between two different public institutions, highlighting how to share a fresh approach to designing new services aimed at the world of business, trade and tourism, and the consequent re-functionalization and enhancement of its given spaces. Nowadays, the role played by fashion industry in contributing to degradation of natural systems is increasingly acknowledged. Acting in terms of information flow from a systemic perspective does not represent a parametric adjustment, nor a reinforcement or a weakening of an existing cycle. It is the generation of a new cycle, that of information, in a place where it was not previously given, therefore inducing a different behavior in people. The structure of information flows can be an effective leverage point in the fashion system, if information is delivered where it was not before, causing people to change behavior. Adding or restoring information, in a fashion system where the information circulating is sometimes not linked to an ethical and social value, can therefore represent a powerful intervention, usually easier and cheaper than reconstructing physical infrastructures. The ambition of this paper is to offer a perspective that faces this complexity and align fashion with sustainability values through insights gained from data. Nowadays, most of the Brazilian population is living in cities, and slums are growing with poor living conditions, in a context of enormous social-economic inequality. One of the local challenges is the poor nutrition of its inhabitants, along with the high cost of healthier food. This paper presents the results of an urban gardening project, developed through the partnership of universities, communities and public institutions at the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. It represents university research and extension projects on building community gardens, aiming at the constitution of a social-economic innovative process to increase local social cohesion, popular protagonism and food sovereignty. Each garden that is part of the Community Gardening Project is facing particular challenges in relation to its social, environmental and economic sustainability, but the initiative is proving to be a significant alternative to humanize those spaces, systemically bringing together approaches as Systemic Design, Agroecology and Food Sovereignty and Solidarity Economy, Integral Endeavours and developing cooperative and innovative actions. While the continuous flow of events seems to be a given, we still cannot either perceive or design space which is organized and has the capacity to reorganize itself in order to cope with major changes. In this framework, the research aims to establish a codefor space, as a semantic system that monitors its sociospatial metabolism while at the same time being directly connected to its material reality. In this framework, the research attempts to establish a design methodologyaiming at a generative system for architecture and the city. The material agency of this productive process is described as a bifold process which constantly informs itself, including a \\\"convergent phase of selection\\\"and a \\\"divergent phase of design\\\" (Spuybroek 2008: 189). The first one focuses on the code\\'s organization, introducing Christopher Alexander\\'s 253 Design Patterns (Alexander et al. 1977) as its elementary units in order to postulate on its topological structure as a network of relations between interacting, active parts. In the next phase, while theorizing the code\\'s structure, Design Patterns are substituted by their A-signifying signs counterparts, mechanisms able to stabilize or destabilize the assemblage and thus allow for its contingency to remain immanent. Currently, we observe a proliferation of data visualizations about Covid-19 in the media, which makes it a convenient time to study the topic from the perspective of different disciplines, including information design and mathematics. If, on the one hand, the abundance of such pandemic representations would already be a legitimate reason to address the issue, on the other hand, it is not the central motivation of the present discussion. The uniqueness of the epidemiological phenomenon that we are experiencing highlights new aspects regarding the production and use of data visualizations, one of which is its diversification beyond counting and visual representation of events related to the virus spread. In this sense, the article discusses, through the analysis of examples, three different approaches for this type of schematic representation, namely: visualization of hypothetical data, visualizations based on secondary data, and visualization for social criticism and self-reflection. Ultimately, we can argue that design contributes to the production of data visualizations that can help people to understand the causes and implications involved in the new coronavirus and encourage civic responsibility through self-care and the practice of social distancing. When the COVID-19 emergency raised, the entire world -and small communities with it- had to stop, adapt, find ways to face the big ongoing challenge. The article reports the reaction and the changes undertaken with an ongoing project that was, in February 2020, experimenting, inside the hospital environment, the therapeutic effects of knitting on people with physical and psychological pathologies. The project, driven by scientific studies made in universities, hospitals and research centers worldwide, had the aim to bring the intervention of designers on the topic, to answer the emerged need to promote research in what is considered a low-investigated and high-promising field. Experimental pilot actions, designed and led by designers on-field, were going on when the emergency changed the scenario, limited the environment, shifted the eye on a new, wider target of healthy people, made knitting a tool to face new circumstances and improve everyday-life quality.Observing the newly emerged scenario and the spontaneous initiatives risen on the web (and on social media in particular) to help individuals in spending the forced time at home in meaningful ways, designers involved in the ongoing project identified in knitting an activity that could be beneficial on a psychological and physical level also for quarantined individuals. The project took a new perspective and evolved in the #IOLAVOROAMAGLIA (#IKNIT) social media campaign, linked to the globally spread #STAYHOME campaign, aimed at inviting people to remain home for preventing the diffusion of the infection, while proposing at the same time new solutions for positively living the emergency times. #IOLAVOROAMAGLIA was embraced by many users and it also became a weekly scheduled live virtual workshop, with a direct reference to the workshops in the hospital of XXXX, temporarily\n",
      "70 This article examines the translation of the Koran in the Java language with title Kitab al-Qur\\'an Tarjamah Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\" by H. Abu Taufiq S. The focus of study in this article is to disclose the background and motivation of the writing of Tarjamah Qur \\'an Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\", revealing the methods used and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the Book Tarjamah Qur\\'an Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\". In addition this article also reveals the community\\'s response to the study of the Koran in the Book Tarjamah Qur\\'an Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\". The analysis of the conclusions in the can are: First, the background and motivation of writing / preparation of the book of the Qur\\'an Tarjamah Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\", in addition to the need for further efforts of the grounding of the Koran is based on impulse some Quran verses. In addition, the Book Tarjamah Qur\\'an Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\" was also inspired by the many customers Jum\\'ah Khutbah book series. Second, the preparation method is the translation of the book according to the methods specified scholars associated with the rules of interpretation as well as relevant rules that must be obeyed. Third, while the excess is technically a book has been systematically arranged, so as to facilitate the reading and searching the desired passages, the translation has been through the process of interpretation, referring to the various books of tafsir, making it easier for readers to understand the biological paragraph. While the drawbacks is that unfortunate book Tarjamah Qur\\'an Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\" has not been evenly distributed, the new focus on the region of Central Java and Yogyakarta, designations in the form of volumes according to juz-Juz sometimes cut relationship between the verse being translated. Then the functional advantages is that for the Javanese in particular, Tarjamah Qur\\'an Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\" become an important reference in the framework of the Islamic propaganda, which is close to the psychological and cultural basis. Fourth, since the release, the book Tarjamah Qur\\'an Basa Jawi \\\"Assalaam\\\" is a demand and a boost by the various parties, both from the congregation culturally and ulema officially through the government. It is not surprising presence responded very positively by the public. This study focuses on the question of the reconstruction of the epistemological interpretation of classical exegesis by offering model mapping study of classical interpretation. The method used is based literary exploratory-qualitative approach. Epistemology of classical interpretation rely solely on aspects of history since the time of the Prophet, his tabi\\'in and generations before the contemporary era that emphasizes the validity of the interpretation of history rather than on naql aspects than aql aspects (ra\\'yu). The Reconstruction for methodological interpretation at all times would be covered by the circumstances that surround the commentators. The method will continue to grow with different perspectives of the commentators in the condition and situation with other commentators. Interpretation will continue to move as long as science itself is constantly moving and human culture is not going nowhere. This article discusses the Qur’anic semantic within hermeneutic discourse. The classical interpretation of the Qur’an (I-IV H) is set to be the subject matter to be discussed within the framework of hermeneutic. By doing so, the article is expected to contribute to giving a new formulation of the classical interpretation discourse on the Qur’an. Besides, the article is also expected to discover the new theory about Qur’anic hermeneutic which operated in the sphere of text. The classical Qur’anic semantic has shown the contestation which not only did it appear in the sphere of meaning (dilalah), but more deeply in played a dialectics of language between oral notion (al-Qur’an/kalam) and the recipient (khitab al-Qur’an). This writing is analytic the book of Muqoddimag Fi Ushuli al-Tafsir issued by Ibnu Taimiyah. In this book give guidance ( Manhaj) in understanding the&nbsp;Qur\\'an by obtaining the basic interpretation discipline and giving distinct among scholars and made tarjih among the differences.

This writing discuss abot phenomena of disaster in the world which actually it has been discussion in the quran. Disaster divided to be two categories according Quran : natural categories and unnatural categories. First categories indicate of God’s decision as like volcanoes. This category refers to God’s decision without human intervention and human could not refuse it.Second category is disaster because of human effort, for instance : flood and land move. By this theologian point of view so disaster had not something given, where human should receive it as it as happened, otherwise role of human possible for changing between a destiny and another destiny, depend on what human endeavor. Finnaly by this theologian understanding , magic consciousness which very integrated with society mind set changing become critical consciousness. Indonesian is a diverse country with a variety of ethnic, class and religion. The potential for conflict over differences, can lead to disintegration of the nation. Reality is happening in the community, just a lot of conflict fueled by religion. Exclusive attitude of each religion, appears due to improper understanding of the substance of religion. For that we need a new understanding about the attitudes that must be done by humans to the existing plurality. Al-Qur’an as a guide to life, must be understood and interpreted by promoting the moral message of the Koran. This paper seeks to provide a view of the new paradigm of Islamic ethics to other communities (the others) in the context of social life. It aims to establish Islamic worldview (Weltanschauung) is based on the principle of rahmatan lil alamin. By optimizing the formulation methodology contextualist interpretation (contextualist interpretation) that the interpretation of the Koran is not just taking care of the language of the Koran, but also the critical aspects of socio-hostorical period of revelation. In this case means trying to revive the prophetic spirit (Prophethood), or with other languages, what would the Prophet will do and provide solutions, if he lived in the days of the moment. So it was concluded that the ethics of Muslims against the others is the attitude cooperatif in advancing human civilization.\n",

Based on the problems faced, then formulated the act of development the Posluhdes that is doing sosialitation, increase the tool and infrastructure, prepare operational budget to the organitation, evolving structure and doing sosialitation vision and mission Posluhdes.Keywords: post rural extension; development. Indonesia develops palm oil biodiesel driven by mandatory biodiesel which requires the use of biodiesel as a mixture of fuel oil by 30 percent. However, the development of the biodiesel can cause a trade off CPO for the production of biodiesel and palm cooking oil. The purpose of this study is to analyze the achievement of Indonesia\\'s biodiesel production, and formulate policies for the development of the biodiesel industry with consideration of the balance of the food and non-food sectors. The data used are secondary data obtained from various related agencies such as the Central Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture, BAPPEBTI, World Bank and other institutions related to this research which are analyzed by dynamic system models. The results of the analysis show that the development of Indonesian biodiesel has not been able to meet the level of the blending rate according to mandatory biodiesel. Efforts to increase the achievement of the blending rate level can be done by providing biodiesel subsidies. Export duty policy is also needed in an effort to maintain the stability of domestic CPO prices and the price of palm cooking oil. The export duty policy in accordance with Minister of Finance Regulation No. 136 of 2015 is more effectively implemented than Minister of Finance Regulation No. 140 of 2016. Keywords : blending rate, dynamic system, mandatory biodiesel, policy scenario AbstractThis study aims to determine: 1) the role of cocoa doctor in adoption production package; 2) cocoa farmer\\'s response to the presence of cocoa doctor; 3) the level of adoption of production increasing package (called 3PP) of cocoa farmers. This research was conducted in Maliwowo Village, Eastern Luwu, South Sulawesi. Samples were 36 people, by simple random sampling method. The analysis employed scoring analysis. The results shows that: 1) the role of cocoa doctor in adoption 3PP in terms of information delivery, absorption ability of information, group planning, cooperation and group institutionalized is the middle category of 53.78%; 2) farmers have agreed response to the presence of cocoa doctor; and 3) farmers adoption levels to 3PP are in the medium category (75%). This implies that the role of cocoa doctor could be expected to improve adoption of 3PP.

This research aimed to describe the cultural values in managing the farming system of “dusun” pattern carried out by indigenous community of Kanum Tribe. The research was conducted in Yanggandur Village, Merauke Regency. Qualitative approach and snowball sampling method were applied to collect the data through interviews from informants. In order to analyze the data it applied data reduction techniques, presentation and conclusion as well as verification. From the research, it was indicated that the prime food crop that cultivated by Kanum Tribe in the “dusun” are ‘kumbili’. The Kanum Tribe still actively managed the farming system of “dusun” pattern because the “kumbili” farming system contained the cultural values which they had inherited from generation to generation. The cultural values contained in “kumbili” cultivation were the safety and religious value, the wisdom and mutual cooperation value, and the responsibility value.Keywords: cultural value; “dusun” pattern farming; Kanum Tribe.

      "75 Precious metals investment is still regarded as the safest investment, other than because its value is stable is also regarded as the instrument that never timeless. But for some people, the desire to invest in precious metals can not be realized because they do not have enough funds. However, these constraints currently not be a problem anymore, because the Islamic pawnshop has been providing mortgage financing of precious metals. One of marketing strategy policy that is used by companies to face their competitors is through promotion mix. In this case, each company has its own promotion mix policy which is diverse, this policy that is aimed to obtain company’s targets in market particularly to attract and fascinate consumers for the products, through this competition, it is not a few number of company who takes shortcuts and justifies any means in order to meet their goals; to earn profits, hence they tend to violate ethic. Islamic business ethic concept does not have any rivalry concept that is likely to ruin others unless synergize and cooperate one another. The variety of products from different manufacturers can offer alternative convenience for the consumers to get products according to their needs and capabilities. Al-Gazali lives in agrarian life which is controlled by authorities who always oversees their workers. Meanwhile, those authorities try to find the legitimacy of their actions bureaucratically, or by appealing for religious leaders’ help in order to be leaved an instruction that supports their actions, or cultural onslaught where governments construct educational facilities. Al-Gazali’s thinkings about economy are based on tasawuf approach (approach of Sufism) due to his period of life, the wealthy, powerful, and prestigious are hard to take fiqih (jurisprudential) and philosophical approach in believing Yaum al-Hisab. In this regard, he focuses on individual behaviour that is being discussed based on perspective of al-Qur’an, Sunnah, sahabat and tabi’in’s instructions, and advices of Sufis who are prominent in his time. An Islamic financial institutions so it should be emphasized that mechanisms and financial and capital structure in accordance with the principles of Sharia, which is not only focused only on achieving maximum profit alone but how to manage the institution for the welfare and convenience of the ummah. In this case the profit is not only to kepantingan owners or founders, but also very important for the development of Islamic banks. Islamic bank profits mainly derived from the difference between the return on investment of funds and the costs incurred during a specific period. In order to obtain optimal results, Islamic banks are required to manage funds effectively and efficiently, both on funds collected from the public, as well as capital funds owner / founder of Islamic banks as well as on the use or cultivation of these funds. Based on the description above in the discussion this time will be described on the capital structure of Islamic financial institutions. And some of the differences between the fund management pattern of conventional banks with Islamic banks, in the management of funds of Islamic banks as well. Can meet the minimum level of liquidity, profitability and solvency were good. Religion (Islam) derived from revelation and has its own norms. Since it is normative, it then is likely to become permanent. On the other hand, culture is man-made and therefore it develops in accordance with time and tend to constantly change. Meanwhile, Islamic culture bases on Islamic values itself videlicet Qur\\'an and Hadith. As long as those customs and cultures are not against Islam, people are pleased to do so. However, if it is contrary to Islamic school, those cultures are inevitably unallowed. The phenomenon of world\\'s interest toward Islamic banking is not only concerned on fiqih muamalah but also on its economic potential as an alternative economic system that has been existed before but has not been able to provide welfare through the societies. South Sulawesi, for instance, as a province which has massive land for agriculture should be able to contribute greatly to inhabitants. Inattentions is the main constraint particularly of banking sector. Hence, to maximize that potency, Islamic banking have to make a strategic alliance to create a partnership with microfinance foundation like Baitul mal wa tamwil in order to get equal expansion, that is conducted by islamic banking, even for underdeveloped communities. The events of the birth of a human child resulting from a relationship not based on valid marriage bond will have an impact on the position of the child, which is the science of civil law known as the illegitimate child or a child out of wedlock. Children born out of wedlock have a negative impact on children in the eyes of the law. Status of children born will be uncertain because there is no authentic evidence to corroborate her that she is the legitimate child of his parents, his position in the eyes of the law is also regarded as an illegitimate son. Consequently, the child only has a civil relationship with the mother and the mother\\'s family, that is, the child has no legal relationship to the biological father. State Concern for protection against illegitimate children is necessary given that no one on this earth who wants ambiguities concerning himself or in other words, no one is willing to bear the status of a child outside marriage. Clarity status, position, and protection under the law of a young man plays an important meaning in the footsteps tread life, the child is the legitimate child and moreover illegitimate child Islam is a religion whose teachings were revealed by Allah to mankind through Prophet Muhammad as the messenger, which in essence bringing teachings not only on one side, but on the various facets of human life. Islam is very concerned with the rights of each individual, because it is one of the objectives of sharia which is to maintain the property of each individual, because the property is an asset of every individual in the form of material that support the sustainability aspects of the life of a servant in the course of worship to God. SWT. related to the above, the title of this research is the concept of property in view of Islamic Economics. The study is a literature review that coverage discussion is that the concept of property in the view of Islamic economics, ownership patterns based on the view of Islam, the ownership of which is protected by Islam. Based on the study conducted, the results of this discussion is the concept of property and ownership in the teachings of Islam, at its core is fully aware that the ultimate owner of everything is God Almighty, applicable human as caliph, only the temporary owner of what he has. Therefore, in every economic action or in an attempt to acquire wealth, people have to go through the road blessed by law both in sourcing, process or utilization of such property. Because at intinnya everything possessed by man will be held accountable by Allah in the Hereafter complaint. Islam as a universal religion, very concerned for justice in human life. Especially to Muslims. Thus Islam has obliged the circulation of wealth occurs in members of the public, a ban on practices accumulated, hoarding on consumer goods, and goods production, because it would result in a very negative because it can damage all the systems that exist in the community and even the world as a whole, which resulted in an imbalance in covering various aspects of life which has been practiced by the capitalists and socialists. Therefore, Islam gives attention to the distribution system which took place in the community by providing strict rules that have been widely disclosed in the Qur\\'an and the hadith of the Prophet. In sharing the problems caused by economic inequality, it is necessary a social justice in the distribution system, namely economic equality. Relaas summon and verdict are two kinds of court prosesses that are related to and influenced each other. Relaas summon’s position on versteck verdict is considered tremendously pivotal, since summon’s process is the first procedure done prior to proceedings, summoning all the parties to attend at trial is crucial for further proceedings as both of litigants presences will be able to assist the judge in listening the reasons from both sides to considered and decided. Relaas summon, in this case, is one of the most authentic act that will be examined first by a panel of judges in order to see if the bailiff or substitute bailiff have been carrying out the duties and responsibilities properly then the summon has been executed officially and seemly. Thus when the relaas summon has been submitted formally and properly while the defendant still does not present under invalid reasons, and did not send his/her attorney as well to be present at the court then this is where the judge considers to decide the case whether defendant will be called again to be able to attend the hearing or the judge directly examines the plaintiff’s witnesses and then settles the case by verstek verdict. The breakdown of the information about the existence of Human Right in Al-Quran along with its entity and nature comprehended by Achmad Abubakar is provided in this paper. The term of Human Rights is begun with the appellation of human existence itself in accordance with the emphasis of human as mustakhlaf Q.S. al-An’am (6) : 165 and as musta’mir (Q.S. Luqman [31] : 20). Allah has created the universe by means&nbsp; of inhabitants duty to prosper it by managing it. Hereinafter, human as basyar implies that they own rights. Thus, by apprehending human existence, an introduction of human dignity is then come out scilicet Human Rights’ entity - using ‘lam’ particle meaning entitlements. By utilizing those rights, it covers all rights owned by people as expressed in Al-Qur’an. Human Rights nature in Al-Qur’an is an explanation of Human Rights’ entity that are the presence of the right to life (Q.S. al-Maidah [5] : 32, the right to own (Q.S. Al-Jum’ah [62] : 10), and the right to believe (Q.S. [103] : 6).\n",
      "76 For the last three decades, there has been a growing interest in the learner centered approaches in the areas of second or foreign language learning. This shift was brought about by the developments taking place in other fields of education which were concerned with exploring how people think and reason. So, this study would conduct a research on the variation of language learning strategies used by first grade students at ESP (English for Specific Purposes) for Faculty of Economics, Merdeka University, Pasuruan. This study used survey study. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are engaged in this project. The population is 140 first grade students in faculty of economics. The researcher took all of the population to be the participant of this study. Based on the findings, it can be shown that the students are the high users of overall language learning strategies. From the meanscore result, it can be shown that the students at faculty of economics employ more to the social and memory language learning strategy because the materials provided by the lecturers was related with speaking and communication skills.

In the context of modern data of linguistics and archeology about the Greco-Indian Parallels in language, epic poetry and material culture there is a substantiation of the thesis concerning the General historical and cultural center of origin and residence of two ancient peoples in the period before their migration from the territory of the ancestral home to mainland Greece and North-West India. Analysis of the data of the ancient tradition, taking into account the results achieved in the study of the languages of the ancient Greeks and the Vedic Aryans, the similarities and parallels in their mythology and epic poetry, the progress achieved (especially recently) in the study of the monuments of the material culture of the ancestors of their carriers in the Eastern Europe era Middle and Late Bronze Age, indicate a greater likelihood of localization of «India» and, accordingly, «Indians» Apollodorus evidence of campaigns of Dionysus, in the Northern Black Sea. Our attention was attracted by two coins attributed by V.A. Anokhin to the issues of King Asander: gold, on the reverse of which the researcher took apart «ΒΑ΢ΙΛΔΩ΢ Α΢ΑΝΓΡΟΤ ΒΟ΢ΠΟΡΟΤ» and bronze, with the legend «ΒΑ΢ΙΛΔΩ΢ Α΢ΑΝΓΡΟΤ» on the flip side. We insist that their attributions given by the researcher are baseless and erroneous. The first of these coins is clearly remakeable, and fantasy. We believe that it was made in modern times for gullible collectors. Moreover, there is no legend on it that brought V.A. Anokhin. We emphasize that the text «ΒΑ΢ΙΛΔΩ΢ Α΢ΑΝΓΡΟΤ ΒΟ΢ΠΟΡΟΤ» could hardly have appeared on the Bosporus coin. It is also important that the photo published by the researcher of this artifact bears traces of thorough retouching. The inscription given by him is indistinguishable. The second coin is certainly genuine. But there is no reason to attribute it to the Bosporus coinage. Coins of the same type have been known for more than a century. They see the ordinary dileptons of the Syrian king Alexander I Balas. One of the most striking elements of Roman period cultures in the the forest and forest-steppe zones of Eastern Europe are bronze items with champlevé enamels. They got their name by a specific geometric ornamentation, in which enamels of different colors were widely used. The set is very stable and in-cludes: jewelry (bracelets, various pendants, chest chains), clothing parts (brooches, buckles and other belt parts) as well as spurs. Some finds of «barbaric enamels» circle are known far from the main area of their distribution – in the south of Eastern Europe in late Scythian, Sarmatian and antiquity cultures burial grounds. Moreover, if the vast majority of forest-steppe enamels are found outside the complexes or in the cultural layer, almost all southern finds come from well-dated burials. The article deals with the issues of chronology and ethnocultural attribution of bronze items belonging to the group of champlevé enamels from sites in the southern part of Eastern Europe. These articles were characteristic of the traditional cos-tume of «northern barbarians» who moved to the southern part of Eastern Europe and Crimea together with the late Sarmatians in late 2nd – middle 3rd centuries A. D. In the focus of this study, the martial law of Cyrenaica, the barbarians\\' raids on the province according to data from the letters of Synesius of Cyrene. Synesius became an eyewitness to the barbaric raids, as well as embezzlement, corruption, which led to the collapse of the military apparatus, as a result, to the death of the province. The article contains letters in which Synesius openly writes about his anxiety about the state of affairs in the province. The study of letters, materials, clarification of the characteristics of the socio-economic development of Cyrenaica will help us to better understand the processes that caused the transition from the ancient society to the medieval. The letters of Sinesia shed light on many questions concerning the provincial life of the empire, agriculture, the social composition of the population, occupations and trades; these are questions that still have not received widespread attention in research circles. In this article we are interested in a separate aspect of Cyrenaica‘s life, namely the martial law and the attitude of Sinesia to the raids of the barbarians, as well as the barbarization of some institutions of society. The purpose of the article is to identify the nature of the use of the term polis in «Church history» of theTheodoret of Cyrus. Research methods: general scientific methods of analysis, synthesis and historicism,historical narrative, historical-genetic and historical-typological methods, comparative analysis of sourcesand historiography, criticism of a historical source. The results of the study: 1) the circle of settlementsindicated by the term polis is wide enough and makes up about one third of the total number ofsettlements mentioned in the «Church history»; geographically these are mainly eastern provinces; 2) allpopulated areas, called polis, can be divided into several groups according to the nature of the mention:the largest church or administrative centers; settlements related to the presence of Christian figures there;settlements related to church life; 3) settlements, called the term polis, were mainly large or significanturban centers; in sources close in time, they are far from always designated as polis. The theme of this work is devoted to the analysis of life and religious activity of St. Saba – the famous ascetic and saint in the V – beginning of the VI centuries AD, famous in the Palestinian desert – on the material of his «Life», written by his student and younger contemporary Cyril Scythopolitanus. Based on the data of the «Life of St. Saba» this article explores the main milestones of the saint‘s life and his activities, the historical and religious background in early Byzantine Palestine in the second half of the fifth and first half of the sixth century, and the role of st. Saba in ongoing events. As a result, we can conclude that st. Saba actively participated in the historical events of the above period and was a very significant figure in the region. His «Life» is highly reliable and it is an important historical source. It gives complex analysis about religious situation in Late Antique Palestine, monasticism there, struggle between religious movements,\n",
      "77 The purpose of this paper is to analyze the flash floods from 1979 and 2009 to explore local wisdom in the community related to the science of natural events (Galodo). This observation activity was carried out by the Galodo incident in Pasie Laweh, Sungi Tarab, Tanah Datar. Negeri Pasie Laweh (Pasla) is a beautiful village located at the foot and slopes of Mount Merapi, one of the highest mountains in West Sumatra Province. Cool air, beautiful and seductive scenery, and residents who always adhere to the philosophy of \\\"Adat basandi syarak, Syarak basandi kittabullah\\\". This means that in addition to having to consider the factor of traditional istadat that has been passed down and carried out in this area, the population also adheres to the holy book of the Qur\\'an as the basis of life. So that the thick Minangkabau nuances are clearly visible in this village. The case of food poisoning in Padang city back then in 2017 – 2018 indicated that various regulations such as government laws and regulations made by the government were still not able to promote cautiousness among consumers in choosing groceries. This also indicated that those law and regulations failed to stop food manufacturer or producer from using harmful substances in food management and processing. Numerous cases of food poisoning were reported on television broadcast or in newspaper almost in daily basis. Based on these facts, we would like to conduct a study to figure out the habit of consumers in buying vegetables mainly in terms of food security (or food safety). This study also aimed to determine the level of knowledge and understanding of people in choosing vegetables that have a good level of food safety. This descriptive-analysis quantitative study focused on consumer awareness of food choices consumed based on food safety, which is measured from the change of community habits in the city of Padang. The subjects of this study were consumers who always shop in the Inpres market, the Alai market and the Lubuk Buaya market. This study is conducted in two stages. In the first stage, we distributed questionnaires that contain public knowledge about food safety to see consumers’ habit in choosing vegetables. Our findings indicated that only 3.2% of consumers understand that the decision to buy vegetables is associated with food security. As much as 54.03% of our subjects do not really care whether the vegetables consumed contain pesticides or not.&nbsp; We provided counselling, guidance on how to select good and healthy vegetables aided by organic vegetable brochures and a pin to mark our consumers. In the second phase, we provided counselling, guidance on how to choose vegetables that are safe to consume and the negative impacts from consuming vegetables that contain residual chemicals from fertilizers and pesticides. The results showed changes in consumers’ behaviour in choosing vegetables that have food safety. Through this study, we expect that the numbers of consumer who aware of the importance of &nbsp;having good level of food safety will increase and therefore will I turn reduce the number of &nbsp;food poisoning cases in Indonesian. Afer 9 month doing online learning, a lot of things can happen in learning and teaching process. The purpose of this research is to know the respond of middle school science teacher to online learning during COVID 19 outbreak. This is a descriptive qualitative research with questionnaire as the research instrument. The sample are 35 middle school science teachers from MGMP IPA Kota Padang. The auestionnaire shows that most of the science teacher do an online learning through this year because of the COVID 19 Pandemis. Whatsaap is the most used application and online learning really helps the teacher with teaching. Furthermore, there are a lot of obstacle with online learning that science teacher faces during COVID 19 outbreak and most of the teachers hope that learning will continue face to face in the classroom. [19:06, 11/12/2020] Fani Yusfita Sari: Indonesia is a developing country that has abundant natural resources, especially palm oil. In Indonesia, a lot of forests are made into oil palm plantations and palm oil mills have been spread throughout Indonesia, one of which is PT Incasi Raya SJAL Lunang Silaut. Here many workers work from the office sector to the fertilization sector. Here they use chemicals that we often hear, namely pesticides . Despite their adverse effects on humans and the environment, pesticides,including herbicides, are often used in oil palm plantations.Paraquat Has been used for more than 40 years in both large and small plantations, paraquat dichloride, known simply as \\'paraquat\\', is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. In Indonesia, \\'paraquat\\' is sold under the name Gramoxone.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are not 20,000 people per year, due to pesticide poisoning. It is estimated that 5,000 - 10,000 people per year experience a very fatal impact, such as experiencing cancer, disability, infertility and liver disease.Here will discuss how the impact will occur if workers do not use safety equipment at work and how to use chemicals properly.not only bad for humans, these pesticides and paraquants are also bad for the environment because if they are used excessively they will reduce soil fertility and plant growth is not normal. Assessment literacy is fundamental for teacher because it is related to decision making task which will then give impact to students’ future. Assessment literacy influences teachers’ routine practice of assessment in classroom. Without knowing the current assessment literacy among teachers, it is difficult to monitor or give relevant reinforcement to improve the quality of assessment practice. Therefore, this study is aimed to figure out the profile of science teachers’ assessment literacy through a 54-items questionnaire developed from Assessment Literacy Standard (ALS) from Michigan Assessment Consortium. The questionnaire consists of selected choice response and open-ended question. Fifteen secondary school science teachers voluntarily participated in this study which came from 9 school in West Sumatra. Then, data was analyzed with descriptive analysis technique. Our findings revealed that while most teachers agreed with the ideal condition of assessment practice stated in the questionnaire, most are not sure when it comes to analyzing data from assessment with statistic tools or taking the use of assessment result further to improve learning quality for both students and teacher themselves. Implication of these findings on the preparation program of science student teacher in Universitas Negeri Padang was discussed further. The purpose of this research is to know the efectiveness of online class on fudamental biophysics class during COVID 19 quarantine. The sample of this research are 70 undergraduate students that is Registered in the even semester of the 2019-2020 school year. The method of this research is qualitative descriptive using google form to collect the data. The result shows that online class on fundamental biohysics during COVID 19 quarantine is not effective. Data shows more than 80% students disagree of studying fundamental biophysic using online class. The data shows that more 50% students not motivated during online learning. This article aims to describe a model of treatment that utilizes plants (plant medicine) found in the Padang tradition, especially Lubuk Buaya and its surroundings. The method used in this research is a qualitative research method and is descriptive in nature with an interactive analysis model. The author concludes that in the medicinal tradition using plants that are assisted by smart people in the Lubuk Buaya community. This tradition has probably been going on from generation to generation. This can be proven by still using this method of treatment. Some traditions may have originated outside the Padang culture which entered into the tradition along with the association of the community with other communities. There is no definite basis (logic) regarding the treatment. Some of the reasons for doing treatment with plants and helping smart people, namely because of traditions / habits and the presence of mystical elements. Another logic is the logic of transition, which is to consider things that are on the help of the smart person. This logic is quite common. This study aimed to figure out what kind of learning resources that science students-teacher used at Basic Inorganic Chemistry Course, especially for the topic of Atomic Structure and Periodical Properties of elements, given the fact that they have studied these topics twice: in Chemistry subject at senior high school and in the second semester at the university. The main background of this study was students’ grades at the end of the semester which was still not living up to the expectation. We believed there could be several factors behind this result. However in this study, we focused on one factor: learning resources. A survey was conducted to figure out: 1) what kind of learning resources that students use; and 2) what are the characteristics of learning resources students expect to have to help them in this course. The data was then analyzed with descriptive statistics technique. Our discussion expanded to the existing learning resources that students can access and what we could offer to help narrowing the gap. This &nbsp;research &nbsp;is &nbsp;related &nbsp;to &nbsp;discovery &nbsp;learning &nbsp;assisted &nbsp;by &nbsp;environmentally friendly APS which is expected to be able to improved the scientific thinking ability of students of science class VIII at SMPN 1 Siman. The data generated from this study are the results of the experimental and control class post-test at the end of learning. The data analysis technique used t-test which has previously tested for pre requisites (homogeneity and normality). Based on the results of the study, it was found that t count = 10,407&gt; t table = 2,069 so H1 was &nbsp;accepted. Furthermore, to find out the extents of the significance of the effect of discovery learning assisted by environmentally friendly APS related to the ability to think scientifically, one tailed follow-up test was conducted.

Where the process of arranging the letter should not only be done in the village office but can be done anywhere. In arranging a cover letter at the Tomang Urban Village office, the community must take care of a conventional cover letter, namely by visiting the Tomang Urban Village office by carrying a file and queuing with other visitors. If the community does not bring enough documents, the community must return home to complete the document shortcomings. For this reason, the author makes a web-based cover letter information system in Tomang Village. Through the method that has been used, namely waterfall. Because with waterfall the system development can be more structured. A web-based cover letter information system is expected to help the community in speeding up the submission process. The design of this information system is a solution to the problems that have been observed to solve the problems that exist in Tomang Village, especially in the cover letter. Abstract - The human resources of a company greatly affect many aspects of determining the work success of the company. One process that is very important in the Human Resources Department of a company or business entity is the promotion process of promotion. In determining who are eligible to be promoted, the company has difficulty making decisions. This is due to the large number of employees who have high quality, while the number of positions needed is limited. In addition, data processing of employee appraisal in the company is still done manually, so that there is a high probability of inputting errors given the very large number of employees and a relatively long time required. For this reason, a decision support system is needed that can help the company in selecting employees to be promoted. The method used is Simple Additive Weighting which starts from identifying the problem and determining objectives, determining criteria and alternatives, determining the weight until the final results are obtained and proceed with a ranking process that will select alternatives that have been provided so that alternative employees are eligible for promotion position. Various moments are immortalized in social networking, one of them Twitter. Twitter is one of the social media that allows users to interact, share information, or even to express feelings and opinions as well as in expressing opinions about \\\"Mudik\\\". Every tweets not all contain the same value, therefore there needs to be a sentiment analysis and tweet classification that discusses about to know the amount of public sentiment to mudik year 2019. This will be a concern for “facilicies transportation for goinghome” next year. One of method used is classification method using k-NN, SVM, Naïve Bayes and Neural Network. The results of this study can be seen that positive sentiments appear more than the value of other sentiments for Mudik 2019, next time negative’s opinion appear more than positive Mudik 2019. and k-NN algorithm has a higher accuracy, it is accuracy=90.76 and AUC=0.939, SVM generated accuracy=89.03% and AUC=0.500, Naïve Bayes generated accuracy=78.16% and AUC=0.567 then Neural Network generated accuracy=52.73% and AUC=0.000. Stocktaking is a calculation and adjustment of the stock of goods and assets owned by a store or company in a warehouse or storefront with stock data contained in the company\\'s database system. During stock taking, the entry and exit activities of goods cannot be carried out. This causes the company to be irregular in conducting stock taking. The purpose of this research is to create a system and application that can simplify the process of managing stock operations. The research method used in this research is using extreme programming method. With this method and the android application, it is expected that the stock management data management process will be more flexible because there is no need to use a computer but only with an Android-based smartphone. With this application, you only need to use the camera on the smartphone to scan the item in question without the need to type on the computer Research on facial images is useful to distinguish the characteristics of each human being. The introduction of healthy and unhealthy facial skin images aims to identify human skin types automatically. For this purpose features such as contrast, correlation, energy, homogeneity, which are features of the Gray Level Co-occurrance Matrices (GLCM) are used. This study proposes a method for analyzing and classifying the GLCM texture on facial skin. The image used in this study was taken in the face image section which consists of the skin of the cheek and the whole face. The methods used are image acquisition, facial skin image, ROI selection, RGB image conversion to gray image, GLCM feature extraction, C4.5 algorithm classification and evaluation. The results showed that the C4.5 algorithm classification on texture analysis of facial images produced an accuracy value of 66.67%, the accuracy value was still low and the need for further research could not be used to increase the accuracy of texture analysis of facial images. To develop reading interest in school students, the school and library must work together to attract students\\' reading interest. One of them is by providing a library at school. At present many school libraries for management are still manual, such as starting from recording member data, bookkeeping data to other data storage related to transaction processing to report generation, so it is possible when the process takes place there are errors in recording, lack of accurate reports made and delays in searching required data. In addition the library has operational hours so that few students come. Designing a web-based library information system with the FAST method is the best solution to solve problems that exist in this library. With the FAST method makes system design easier and on target. And with the existence of a website-based library information system increases students\\' interest in reading because they can access anywhere and anytime without limited time, making it easier for officers to manage library data Academic information systems at the University are only able to support operational activities but have not been able to provide specific reports needed by the leaders. The system development method used is waterfall model which consists of four stages. System that will be developed is aims to make it easier for leaders to obtain information about academic activities. So that later, total student growth and total growth of graduating students by year can be monitored well. Likewise, total of active, non-active and drop-out students can be known quickly. The data can be used to assist the decision making process.\\n&nbsp; Repeater Sales Information System is a management information system that produces various information that can be useful to support sales activities at PT. Picotel Nusantara. The manifestation of the development of the Repeater\\'s sales information system is the making of computer applications that are able to represent the whole designed information system. Produced sales information system applications are able to manage sales data, which includes sales transactions, cash receipt transactions, item data, data purchase orders, account data, and customer data in an organized manner, and produce complete, accurate and always current reports for each level of management . In writing this final assignment, the author uses the waterfall methodology, in this method there are several stages, namely the survey stage, the system design stage, the coding stage, the testing stage, the maintenance stage. From the method that I use, the authors build applications that can be used for the sales process, as well as promotions to customers, so that this application can be expected to be implemented by PT. Picotel Nusantara. The information system approach method used in this information system uses object-oriented methods (object oriented) which emphasize problem solving software based on objects. The system design uses Java and the database design uses MySql Server. The results of the design of sales information system applications show that the role of computer applications in information systems is very important as a support in improving the quality of sales and service activities in the company environment. Human Resources (HR) is one of the valuable assets owned by each company. HR management requires a clear standardization in order to contribute positively to a company or organization. In terms of recruitment, the company needs to do HR planning in order to meet the demand for human resources. The main objective of the process of hiring a permanent employee contract that is to get the right people who meet certain requirements to fill the positions that are necessary, so that the person is able to work optimally and can survive in the company for a long time. In the system of appointment of contract workers into permanent employees of PT. Aranad work Saranatama implement some of the things the possibility of an employee or the terms of the contract can become permanent employees at PT. Aranad Saranatama work, one that the company is indeed in need of an employee, as well as the desire of a contract employee to work as a permanent employee in PT. Aranad Saranatama work. Because of it, not all contract employees can become permanent employees there should be the selection of a leader of the company to be able to accept an employee in the company. Internet technology is no longer just known as assistive devices or entertainment purposes only but has evolved into one of the tools in the learning system. Learning can be done anywhere and anytime. The learning process will not achieve optimal results if not balanced diversity of approaches and methods, both individual and group approach. This means that instead of teacher teaching resources but also other learning resources to meet the educational elements. Teachers in schools in accordance with the functions assigned to optimize the ability of students in the learning process in the classroom. The role of the teacher in question is all matters relating to all aspects including approaches to teaching in schools. But what happened in school today are teachers who tend to simply explain and tell something to the students alone and glued to the existing textbooks. Learning model like that many students is more passive and less likely to feel bored. Therefore, teachers should be able to change the old paradigm by utilizing internet technology in the learning process in the classroom are not only using textbooks. Research on cervical cancer with the Pap Smear method is useful for finding pre-cancer diagnoses. Associated with previous research that the accuracy of the Naïve Bayes algorithm to the classification of a single Pap smear image still has an unsatisfactory accuracy. Whereas determining the class of single Pap cell smears is very important in determining whether these cells are normal or not. This study aims to determine whether integration using the Sample Bootstrapping (SB) method with the Weighted Principal Component Analysis (W-PCA) algorithm can improve the performance of the Naïve Bayes algorithm for seven different cell types. This model is the best solution used in the classification of datasets that are classified as having large dimensions. So that the integration of the two algorithms can increase the accuracy value to 87.24% for the seven classes and 97.30% for the two classes, and it can be concluded that with this integration model can improve the best accuracy value.\n",

      "82 We propose an analysis of El comprador de aniversarios (2002) by Adolfo García Ortega, published at the beginning of the memory boom in Spain, as a posttraumatic narrative of mourning. We single out the novel from among other contemporary novel son the Spanish Civil War for its way of approaching the past, its use of fiction and for its subject. We draw parallels that exist between the novel and Dora Bruder (1997) by Patrick Modiano, which could have influenced García Ortega’s. The result of this mourning narrative is another way of understanding our relation in the present with (an)other violent past(s). Presentation of the current volumen with a brief status of the issue and brief summaries of the articles. In this paper, we analyze the articles that María Teresa León wrote for the periodical publication España Republicana during 1941 and 1942, in order to describe the author\\'s consideration of women in different roles and situations within the framework of a particular historical conjuncture. This allows us to think of new ways of interpreting historical processes, emphasizing the collective experience of women defenders of the Spanish Republic. Holopoetry explores the boundaries of space and reception and stands as a tridimensional, non-material lyric. Eduardo Kac’s work pioneers the genre, not only by his theoretical texts, but more importantly for his artistic creations. The lecture of holographic poems can only be conceived in terms of the lecturer’s point of view, with their approach to the work and its own motion. Thus, the constantly changing text becomes an event developed in both the spatial and temporal categories and generates a remarkably new aesthetic experience, mutable and different from one spectator to another. This paper analyzes two books of poems arising from the intellectual climate that justified Fukuyama’s prediction about the end of history. On the one hand, Manuel Vázquez Montalbán (Praga, 1982) built a discursive labyrinth in which the Czech city represented the metaphor for the crisis of communism, the utopian disenchantment, the fractured country and the private memory. On the other hand, Antonio Martínez Sarrión (Cantil, 1995) proposed an allegorical journey that went back to the origins of Nazism and to the ekphrastic description of the picture The Island of the Dead, by Arnold Böcklin, in order to denounce the self-destruction of a world that has evolved from totalitarianism to consumer society. Separated by the symbolic bisector of the year 1989, Praga and Cantil came in from the cold ?the inclemency of political disillusionment in the former, and the disappointment derived from any civilizing project in the latter? to rewrite history from the end of history. This essay focuses on the use of the castle as a leit motiv in the intimate poem \\\"Diseminado\\\", belonging to La galerna (1969-1974), Blas de Otero’s posthumous book of poems. This symbol carries a special significance within the Western cultural imaginary. In \\\"Diseminado\\\", however, it belongs to the ideological or notional field of the epic and shows negative connotation derived from the amargo memories of Blas de Otero as a soldier, which can be traced in other poems related to his war time experience, such as \\\"Imbatida juventud\\\", from Que trata de España (1959). The chacona [chaconne] was one of the most widespread and practiced dances from the end of the sixteenth century in Spain. With no surviving choreographic indications and barely any music scores preserved, it is mentioned repeatedly in various literary texts. As a sung dance and with its distinctive repetitive refrain—or bordoncillo — revealing its name and theme, or in modern terms its slogan, the chaconne was not only used in romancerillos and pamphlets, but also in comedies, and, in a turned “a lo divino”, in the autos sacramentales. The dance was to become what could be categorised as a poetic and paratheatrical subgenre, closely related to the bawdy, licentious and satirical themes set to music and sung in the romances and letrillas. My proposal focuses on Najat El Hachmi case study, in particular with relation to the writer’s ethnic-cultural identity and the one of the protagonist of the novel La filla estrangera (2015), the daughter the title refers to. First I define de idea of transnational literature in Catalonia, then I describe El Hachmi’s compromise with identity and the Catalan language in the light of the phenomenon of translingualism. Second, I present the novel’s salient points related to the desire and the seek of a difficult cultural integration Among the famous illustrators who provide an inconditional support to the rebel cause, there is Antonio de Lara, also known as Tono. He represented the Art-Deco movement in the 20s; over time his art becam simpler under cubist, surrealist, dadaist or constructivist influences. His style was from then on easily identifiable, mostly for the geometric drawing of his cartoon characters but also trough the absurd situations reminiscent of the English nonsense tradition, introduced in Spain by Ramón Gómez de la Serna. Tono, in France when the Civil War broke out, decided to cross the border in order to join the self-proclaimed “nationalists”, giving up his traditional apolisticism. He played an important part in emblematic magazines such as Vértice or La Ametralladora. In 1938, he published a book called 100 tonerias in which he collected one hundred cartoons. Most of them caricature the enemies with a number of characters who, like a comic, end up building an original universe with its own code and who are an efficient vehicle of propaganda. This article explores an imagery of absence in Rosalía de Castro’s “As viúdas dos vivos e as viúdas dos mortos”, one of the first poetic texts to approach the impact of Galician emigration on 19th century country women. Starting from a formal and stylistic analysis, I probe into representations of male absence, as seen in the poems included in this section of the volume Follas Novas. In particular, I examine the way in which the widow’s voice breaks with representations of female fragility and turns her into the spokesperson for social unrest. On March 10, 1939, Un hombre y su vida, by Salvadora Medina Onrubia (1894-1972), an argentinian journalist and writer, an anarchist and feminist activist, was premiered in Buenos Aires. As she points out, the play, written in 1936, was born \\\"under the advocation of the intense moment of Spain\\\", the Civil War, but, significantly, it is staged when the outcome was imminent. In this paper, we will focus on the reception of the première in the argentinian press through the reviews included in newspapers of different ideologies.\n",

This study aims to analyze the relationship between family support and spiritual needs with the level of anxiety of chronic kidney failure patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy at Bangkinang Hospital in 2020. This study used a cross sectional research design. The population in this study were 47 patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy in the hemodialysis unit at Bangkinang Hospital. The sample in this study patients who underwent hemodialysis therapy were 47 people with a total sampling technique. Collecting data through distributing questionnaires. Data processing used univariate and bivariate analysis. The results showed most respondents had low family support as many as 25 people (53.2%), most respondents had low spiritual needs as many as 29 people (61.7%), most respondents experienced high anxiety levels as many as 30 people (63, 8%). The results of the Chi-square test found that there was a significant relationship between family support and spiritual needs with the level of anxiety of chronic kidney failure patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy at Bangkinang Hospital. It is recommended that the hospital be able to provide counseling about family support and spiritual needs in order to reduce the anxiety level of chronic kidney failure patients. Toilet training is an important aspect in the development of toddler age children, namely children aged 1 to 3 years where parents must pay more attention to defecation and urination. Learning toilet training in children is the first step in establishing children\\'s independence.

      "84 English language is an International language. This makes the use of English in teaching-learning process in countries, where English is generally not a local medium of communication, become important. Mathematics is also very important for every student, but several previous research showed that students had difficulty in learning this subject. The purpose of this experimental study is to see the effectiveness of the use of English in teaching-learning process of economic mathematics towards economic undergraduate students. The result shows us that students who learn mathematics with English-medium system have better achievement than students who learn mathematics with local language. Another finding was students learn mathematics more enthusiastic when the teaching-learning process is made with the language they chose.Keyword: English language, economic mathematics, teaching learning. This study aims to improve the mathematical communication ability of junior highschool students. Research using cooperative learning model type Student Teams AchievementDivision (STAD) and Buzz Group type. This research uses two classes namely class VII-A andVII-E SMPN 3 Parongpong, West Bandung. The test instrument is a test of mathematicalcommunication ability on the subject of data presentation. Non-test instruments are aquestionnaire of student responses to know their preferences and benefits for mathematicslearning. The test used is t-test at the 0.05 significance level. The results showed that: 1)Student\\'s mathematical communication ability before obtaining cooperative learning typeStudent Teams Achievement Division (STAD) and Buzz Group type are not different and are inlow category. After the treatment of mathematical communication experience Improvement.Increased mathematical communication ability of students who obtained cooperative learningmodel type Student Teams Achievement Division (STAD) and Buzz Group type increased inhigh category, 2) There was no significant difference in the improvement of mathematicalcommunication ability between students who obtained cooperative learning model type StudentTeams Achievement Division (STAD) and Buzz Group type, 3) Student response indicates thatstudents are very fond of cooperative learning model of Student Teams Achievement Division(STAD) type and Buzz Group type. Teachers needs to be aware that there is no single way to learn the most correct,there is no way to teach the best or superior, because peoples are differ in intellectual abilities,attitudes, and personality. There can be no \\'right test\\' way to study nor \\'best\\' way to teach.Teachers are free to choose their own way and style in teaching and learning to achieve thegoals that have been determined by considering the conditions of each student. But there is alittle message in the particular subject matter of mathematics teaching in the classroom thatcreate an impression of each student when they leave the classroom students are expected todiscuss pleasant things which has happened, beside mathematics, to the new math coursefollowed, and it is expected that they will continue to smolder spirit until the next day. Thereforteachers need such effort and patience in providing the right motivation. Strong motivation inmathematics teaching is not just words, but stimulation through teaching techniques as theproper way to make students happy and more interested towards mathematics. The ways thatexpected to eliminate problems such as fear or mathematics anxiety, which is a commonproblem for many years. Faith based learning correlates learning particular subject matter inmathematics with the Word of God, students are directed always willing accept wisdom andknowledge of God. Teaching that leads to the heavenly teaching method to love God. Teachingin accordance with the criteria written in the book of Galatians 5:22-23, which are; love, joy,peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and selfs control. ThePENDEKATAN FAITH LEARNING DALAM PEMBELAJARAN MATEMATIKAKartini HutagaolFakultas Keguruan dan Ilmu PendidikanUniversitas Advent Indonesiakartinih_smant@yahoo.com33expecttation by integrating faith in the teaching of mathematics is to form student Godlycharacter for present and eternal life to come. The ability of creative thinking is one of the important mathematical skills, but fromthe results of previous research indicates the low ability of students\\' mathematical creativethinking. One of the factors causing the low ability of students\\' mathematical creative thinkingbecause students who are less active in expressing ideas creatively in solving problems,sparked his ideas, and detailed the problem. Therefore, it is needed a learning model that canaccelerate students\\' activeness in solving math problems. The author conducted research onthe application of Search, Solve, Create and Share (SSCS) model and Problem CenteredLearning (PCL) model to help improve students\\' mathematical creative thinking ability. Datacollection techniques use test instruments to measure student learning outcomes. The resultsof this study indicate that: (1) students\\' creative thinking ability using Search, Solve, Createand Share (SSCS) model is in high category, while PCL model is in moderate category, (2)there is a significant difference between improvement the ability of mathematical creativethinking between students who obtained the Search, Solve, Create and Share (SSCS) modeland students who obtained the PCL model, and (3) the students\\' response to Search, Solve,Create and Share (SSCS) models and PCL entered into \\\" like \\\". Mathematics is one of the subjects which is learned at all levels of education. Ithappens because mathematics is used and needed in every aspect human activity. One of theabilities students must possess is the ability to solve problems. Facts in Indonesia show thatstudents\\' mathematical problem-solving abilities at both secondary and tertiary educationlevels are still not high. From previous studies reported that only 35% of students had problemsolvingskills, 25% of students were able to design completion plans and 20% of students hadthe ability to solve problems. The remaining 20% are students who have the ability to lookback at the completion steps. Looking at the research reports above, the teachers are expectedto choose the right strategy to be used in carrying out the learning process in the classroom sothat the goals that have been written in the teaching plan can be achieved. A learning modelcalled \\\"Everyone is a Teacher Here (ETH)\\\" is an alternative learning to improve students\\'mathematical problem solving abilities. The ETH Learning Model provides opportunities forall students to act as \\\"instructors\\\" to their peers or in other words \\\"peer tutors\\\". Anotheralternative learning that can be used to improve students\\' mathematical problem solving skillsis the Quantum Teaching learning approach. The Quantum Teaching Approach can givestudents an active learning that stimulates the student\\'s brain so that learning can runoptimally. This Quantum Teaching Approach has an activity framework in the form of Grow,Experience, Name, Demonstrate, Repeat, and Celebrate. Today it is often seen on television shows that moral damage to national graduatesis very worrying, acts of corruption (bribery cases), juvenile delinquency, brawls betweenstudents with physical violence, brutal suicide bombings, and anarchists. In responding to thereality of the moral crisis, the alarming character crisis faced by the Indonesian Nation, the2013 Curriculum has emphasized and directed the nature of education to improve attitudes,which is the essence of education in the real context, as also believed by Ki Hadjar Dewantara,MODEL PEMBELAJARAN KOOPERATIF ING NGARSA SUNG TULADHAKartini Hutagaol1, Louise M. Saija2, Debora C. Simanjuntak390regarding the effort in debriefing the national spirit , the spirit of brotherhood, protecting thosewho apply values that exemplify manners, to form moral people, who have a mind set (tocommit) that is in harmony with social values. The author team conducted a cooperativelearning model design that inspired the idea of Ki Hadjar Dewantara, as revealed by Soedjadi\\\"is it not possible to develop learning models or methods that rely on our own philosophy?Furthermore, Soedjadi said, \\\"once again, it is not impossible that new developments aboutlearning models in Indonesia, that model will affect learning in Indonesia.\\\" To addressSoedjadi\\'s expression, the writer\\'s team was challenged to design Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha\\'scooperative learning model, in response to Soedjadi\\'s statement (1999, p. 104) \\\"The authorfeels confident that it is possible to construct a learning model that breathes the idea of KiHadjar Dewantara. This early stage research is conducting an empirical study of learningmodels designed to direct, instill attitudes and character in which the teacher / lecturer isplaced or positioned as a leader, who will provide examples or good examples continuously,giving noble examples to those he leads . All of that aims to ignite the souls of the graduates tobecome leaders who have a nationality, unity, brotherhood, without discriminating ethnicity,customs, and religion, so as to avoid violence and anarchism. Empirical study research in theprocess of running, carried out in higher education, high school, junior high school,elementary school in the West Java region. The target population of tertiary education isstudents of the Faculty of Economics in West Java who study Mathematics Economics, andstudents of elementary, middle and high school in West Java. In this empirical research thefirst phase involved 3 students of English B. Study Program and 3 students of MathematicsStudy Program. Provisional assumptions that attitudes, learning outcomes, teamwork,leadership ability, ability to ask questions and provide answers to questions from students arebetter than those who do not use Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha\\'s Cooperative Learning Model. Mathematical communication ability is one of the mathematical ability in learning mathematics. This comparative design research aimed to see whether the mathematical communication enhancement of students who acquire Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha learning model is significantly better than students who acquire Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition learning model. The sample in this research are students of two grade 7th classes in SMP Negeri 5 Lembang, Bandung Barat. Students in class VII-D acquire Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition learning model, and students in class VII-B acquire Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha learning model. Results of this study showed that the students’ mathematical communication enhancement, both who acquire Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition or Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha learning model categorized as “moderate”. More further, the mathematical communication enhancement of students who acquire Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha learning model is significantly better than students who acquire acquire Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition learning model. Another result is that students like the learning model, either Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition or Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha. \\nKey Words: Mathematical Communication, Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition,&nbsp; Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha.

The findings in this study are that the increase or gain of students who learn with multi- representation strategy is significantly different compared&nbsp; with the gain of mathematical problem solving ability of students who study with conventional. Students with a high prior knowledge prefer algebraic representation and are more skilled in using various forms of reprentation, early knowledgeable students prefer desk representation and low-priority students prefer schematic representations. Furthermore, the interaction is more effective for students with moderate and low knowledge.\\n&nbsp;\\nKeywords: Multi Representation Strategy, Student Mathematical Problem Solving Ability Many of high school students find difficulty in studying three dimensional geometry. They find difficulty in understanding three dimension objects such as cube, cuboid, pyramide, etc. Most students fail to make correct perception about the distance to calculate, when the problems are dealing with lines or planes. Only students with good spatial capability can solve such problems.&nbsp; This research focused on making new approaching method to understand and then calculate the distance in a three dimensional objects. The approach is vector approach, including develop connection vectors, normal vector of a plane, and calculating distance from a point to certain line or plane using vector theorems. The Approach was tested by experimental study to a class of XII grade of high school students in SMAN 1 Parongpong, Indonesia, &nbsp;consists of 30 students, and conducted in six meeting. A similar class treated with the conventional spatial approach as the control class. SPSS 20 was used to analyze the research data. Based on the research data analysis, the conclusion of the study was &nbsp;that students treated with vector approach achieve higher performance improvement compare with the students treated with conventional approach.

      "85 This work analyzes the formal aspect of the headboards, as well as the visual communication and the functional contribution of the header blocks in the Spanish online press of general information, with the purpose of knowing the communicative guidelines and the practical support that they contribute to the media user. In the research, the methodology of content analysis is used and the recording of the data is carried out by means of a self-created analysis instrument, mostly made up of manifest variables. The sample is made up of the top ten general newspapers of the audience ranking. The study allows to conclude that the stain maintains its identity character and a privileged position, but the header block is articulated by an independent visual code, based on the use of graphisms and color, both to differentiate the navigation options and the resources offered, as to highlight some of them. This article is focused on the regular and constant presence of TV in Pedro Almodóvar’s movies. Television, starting from Almodóvar´s first film (Pepi, Luci, Bon y otras chicas del montón, 1980), acquires relevance that will be the object of study from a discursive and aesthetic point of view. The methodology consists in the bibliographic research and the analysis of the scripts, drafts, press kits and films. Kika (1993) is not the only film by Pedro Almodóvar where TV is implanted. Quite on the contrary, we shall see that the TV set has practically a constant presence in Almodóvar’s oeuvre. As a result, it is important to mention the object value of the TV screen and the bodily position in front of the TV set. Furthermore, we will underline an itinerary on the discourses on television in the filmography of Almodóvar. Point-of-view shots are a powerful resource when they are used in their canonical structure, but they also have great aesthetic potential when this structure is altered to break the spectator’s expectations. For example, in the cases of «false point-of-view shots» in which the viewer faces the need to reassess the subjective condition of the plane that she observes when the character with whom he thought she was sharing the look appeares in it. All false point-of-view shots produce experiences that share certain phenomenological qualities caused by the way they act on the expectations and perception of the viewer. This article reflects on four of these effects, describing their general scope and analyzing their expressive possibilities in two scenes of L’Eclisse (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1962) and Death in Venice (Luchino Visconti, 1971). This paper analyses the construction of the teenage character in European serial fiction through the analysis of 23 Net-flix Originals with a methodology that combines quantitative and analytical-descriptive elements. To establish the dif-ferences and parallels between the teenage characters of the different European series, a total of 132 characters have been classified around 18 variables of analysis, focusing on issues of representation and aspects of the storyline, emphasizing the importance of the peer group for the teenage character, as well as the existence of a behavior that, sometimes, is in-consistent with the age it portrays. In his memoirs as an Auschwitz survivor, Primo Levi developed the concept of grey zone to explain the different ways in which the Nazi regime led its Jewish enemy to a process of self-destruction by diffusing the line between victim and executioner. In the aftermath of Auschwitz, this concept quickly spread beyond the limits of the camp and promptly became a necessary piece for the understanding of what happened during the Holocaust, above all due to the accuracy of a concept, grey zone, that still interact with the present. Seventy-five years after the Second World War finished, cinema is one key actor in the preservation of the debate on the Holocaust thanks to the strength of its images. Recent different films on this subject evidence the importance of remembering what happened then so that the memory of the Jewish genocide could be maintained, especially when the survivors are fewer. In this sense, the aim of this article is to study how that concept of grey area developed by Levi –and its different contemporary interpretations– is manifested in today’s cinema, in order to understand the importance of the term and how it has been potentially nourishing a new ethics and aesthetics. Art is a powerful means of communication used in many advertising campaigns to attract, generally, exclusivity values exclusivity to the advertised product. This text analyses a specific campaign where art is used as a slogan to refer to the low price by communicating that the product does not lose quality. This is the campaign ‘Preciobajismo’, carried out for the Lidl chain in Spain. By means of a discourse analysis, we study how the concept of art has been introduced in this campaign. The aim is to illustrate different materializations of intertextuality art - advertising in a campaign, which, a priori, seems to be removed from the usual prestige sense of the use of art in advertising. In general, it could be said that in this campaign all types of art-advertising intertextuality described by reference authors appear, raising the specific relation of the product with art. Thus, the spot identifies, represents, mentions or suggests specific artists, works, movements and museums. Likewise, Lidl presents an artistic movement associated with the reason of its entity and its campaign: its low prices, through the fictional movement ‘Preciobajismo’, presenting all the variables of any artistic movement: name, philosophy, place, artists, critics and works of art. Based on a work of literature review, this paper investigates the main recurring aspects of contemporary queer cinema, specifically features starring and/or directed by LGBTQIA+ persons in the last decade. The starting point is a number of authors who, inspired by B. Ruby Rich’s work in characterizing the New Queer Cinema movement in the 1990s, set out to identify which political and aesthetic aspects stand out in the current queer filmography – and how they reflect the LGBTQIA+ community’s present moment. Once their theories are put in dialog, it becomes clear how, through the recurrence of a realistic approach to narratives of romantic frustration, movies like Weekend and End of the Century reflect upon homonormativity, privilege, and modes of existence in the current queer experience. By highlighting these parallels, these authors show how contemporary films reform New Queer Cinema’s references – and which concept of queer cinema they elaborate on the screen. The release of 13 Reasons Why in March 2017 attracted not only audiences worldwide, but also a considerable amount of academic attention. A good share of the academic production on the series, though, have focused mostly on its effects. For this reason, and in an attempt to approach the debate from complementary angles, this paper aims at examining the motivations expressed by those involved in the creative process of the show and compared them with the actual discourse in the series’ first season. In order to do that, the methodology triangulates between quantitative and qualitative techniques to approach the research problem from equally complementary angles. The results of these analyses confirm that the creators’ motivation go beyond the mere entertainment, but also inconsistencies between the discourses in Beyond the Reasons and 13 Reasons Why’s first season. Teen fiction series act as important socializing agents. The female stereotypes represented in them have the power to reconfigure the viewers’ identity construction, who will assume certain roles and apply them to their reality. This paper, which identifies a slow and superficial change in series aimed at adults (through Content Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)), analyzes female stereotypes and their relationtship with cyberbullying in series such as Gossip Girl, Pretty Little Liars and Get Even. The story’s messages and values address the dulcification of sexual violence, toxicity within love, the trivialisation of death, the commercialisation of sex, the cult of beauty and technology dependence. The results reveal the existence of a real debate regarding gender and equality, but without tools that empower women against cyberbullying, which continues to represent the woman as the victim. Audio-visual productions, such as television series, use youth stereotypes that reflect reality and simultaneously construct it by disseminating simplified models that are used as codes for social labelling. Social types are characterized by a set of personal traits, social environment, clothing, lifestyle, etc. In the characterization of the characters, the use of musical re-sources has been studied to a lesser extent. The series «Stranger Things» stood out especially for the use of diegetic and extradiegetic music both in the period setting and in the characterization of characters. In characterizing characters, it offers a special case of the use of transmedia resources that humanizes them and intensifies the emotional connection with the audience. Netflix and Spotify designed and published playlists of their characters including musical styles that characterized them. We analyse here the playlists of adolescents and young people in Strange Things, exploring, through correspondence analysis, what styles characterized them and what type of adolescent and young person they described. The analysis operatively triangulates the audio-visual characterization with the musical one. The types of young people are divided into two cleavages: the first is race (defines two types) and the second is the degree of social adjustment (de-fines four types of young adolescent). The 21st century has witnessed the rebirth or rediscovery of the classical superhero stories, thanks to the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, this success has been replicated, so far, into other screens such us TV. Moreover, the serialized television format has allowed Marvel to show other kind of tales not so suitable for the big screen. We are talking about narratives of teen superheroes, inspired by the comic-book sidekick tradition. This paper seeks to analyze the origin stories of main superhero characters in Cloak and Dagger and Runaways series, emphasizing the problems and the context for a hero apprentice when he or she is a teenager too. For this task, we will rely on some of the most well-known characteristics of the Bildungsroman or coming-of-age genre.\n",
      "86 Today, the Zionist occupation of Palestine and the continued dislocation of Palestinians for nearly a hundred years through brute force – combined with the former’s discursive hegemony over its victims – remain as major obstacles to the construction of a peaceful and stable international political order in the Middle East. The so-called Palestinian problem remains the key to understand the failure of the Middle Eastern sub-system to produce sustainable peace in the region. This brief introduction to the special issue seeks to explain the general perspective and summarise main arguments of the contributors who have approached the issue of Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the lenses of various fields of study such as international law, foreign policy analysis and discourse analysis. As will be seen, all the authors offer notable critical reflections that challenge established understandings of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within the mainstream Western media and scholarly literature. This article aims to explore emerging trends for the Sunni religious elite and the Islamic legal tradition in the new context of the Arab Uprisings by focusing on Yusuf al-Qaradawi, arguably the most prominent of these ʿulamāʾ alive today. The article will follow al-Qaradawi’s articulation, transmission and reconstruction of the Islamic legal tradition in his own discourse as he has attempted to negotiate the politically fraught contexts of the Arab Uprisings while also maintaining his horizontal commitments to a diverse base of supporters be they the wider Arab Muslim public, the Muslim Brotherhood or indeed the Qatari royal family. The article will focus on al-Qaradawi’s highly publicised interventions and fatwas in relation to Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, and Syria from the perspective of Islamic studies, and also draw on personal interviews with al-Qaradawi, his personal staff, as well as supplementary media. In so doing, the article will elucidate al-Qaradawi and his colleagues’ attempts, ranging from the highly creative to the markedly conservative, to respond to unfolding events through the legal tradition and play an increasingly active role in the public sphere while their own status simultaneously becomes ever more vulnerable and unstable. In this paper, I examine the rise of the Al Nour Salafi party that won 27 percent of the vote in the 2011 Egyptian parliamentary elections. I present a new explanation for their popularity based on the analysis of ethnographic data collected in Alexandria. I question the prevalent explanation that Al Nour’s rise is mainly due to the party’s active response to the socioeconomic grievances of the marginalized poor, who are more susceptible to indoctrination by radical religious parties. I demonstrate its limitations by highlighting the scarce evidence that Al Nour carries out significant charity work. Also, while some of its supporters express socioeconomic grievances, Al Nour voters represent different social classes. I present an alternative explanation based on social movement theory paired with Bourdieu’s theory of habitus and argue that the Al Nour politicians disseminate and promote a discourse of Salafi social justice and leverage it to rally supporters. Already exposed to the Salafi habitus, Muslims who attend mosques controlled by the Da’wa Salafiyya are encouraged to extend their religious practices into actions in support of the party. To nuance this analysis, I also briefly discuss the motives of Salafi subgroups that are not necessarily active within Al Nour, such as Salafi women. While they are embedded in a similar Salafi habitus, they usually embrace different discursive practices and choose to remain outside of politics. Since the rise of Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power in 2002, the country has been at the forefront of events in the region and beyond, even more so in the wake of the 15 July 2016 failed coup attempt. The party’s initial pro-EU, pro-democratic posture has given way to an illiberal authoritarianism since 2010, a process that has yet to reach its denouement. Tahir Abbas’ worthy ambition in Contemporary Turkey in Conflict: Ethnicity, Islam and Politics is to chart the path of sociopolitical transformation Turkey has undergone over the last decade or so, by surveying some of the key ideas and actors shaping contemporary Turkish politics... The academic field of Kurdish studies has experienced considerable growth in recent years. Compared to the later decades of the 20th century that were characterized by the scarcity and scattering of resources and researches on Kurdish subjects, today one can find an ever-growing variety of studies in international languages to satisfy his/her own curiosity on this matter. Recent political developments in the region (i.e. the involvement of Kurdish groups in the resistance against the ISIS, the relative self-determination of the Kurds in Syria, the resurgence of armed conflict in Turkey since 2015 after the failure of the so-called “peace process”, and the referendum on the independence of Iraqi Kurdistan in 2017) have raised academic interest and increasingly put the Kurds on the world agenda. By itself, this can be heralded as a positive development in Middle Eastern studies at large; however – and this is the main argument and the foundational stance the of the book here reviewed – this recent attention has been predominantly structured along narratives of “conflict and resistance” that often prevent us from seeing other aspects of Kurdish culture and society. Indeed, the amount of academic production related to the Kurdish culture at large is significantly, and perhaps disproportionately, lower than that regarding geopolitical, political and military aspects. Nevertheless, now – in the nick of the time – the volume entitled Rediscovering Kurdistan’s Cultures and Identities: The Call of the Cricket has emerged with the aim of counterbalancing the above disproportion. The aim of this article is to analyse the resolution of the crisis between Turkey and Russia. The diplomatic crisis erupted when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on its border with Syria on 24 November 2015. The diplomatic crisis went hand in hand with an extensive economic embargo. Russia suspended the reciprocal visa-free regime with Turkey, as well as banning charter flights to and from Turkey. Russian travel firms were told by Moscow to stop marketing Turkish holiday programs. Moreover, Putin signed a decree calling for a ban on imports of certain goods from Turkey. After a period of intensity, however, the leaders of the two countries (President Putin and President Erdoğan) decided to reset the relations. The failed coup attempt in Turkey in 2016 provided a window of opportunity for the resolution of the crisis. In light of this background, the article puts forward an analysis of both the system level factors (international conjecture) and domestic factors (military capabilities, economic capacity and government type). The article puts a special emphasis on how the failed military coup in Turkey constituted a decisive turning point for Turkey-Russia relations in recent years. Using the Manifesto Project’s dataset, this article considers two questions: Where does the AKP stand vis-à-vis other parties in Turkey? What were the dynamics of party competition in recent Turkish elections? With regards to the first question, the article finds that the AKP’s manifestos are closer to those of center-right parties in Turkey, rather than to those of Islamist parties. It also finds that in the AKP’s overall discourse, the most important and persistent element is a focus on technocratic issues, referring to promises such as more investment in education, cultural activities, and technology and infrastructure, which are relatively uncontroversial in Turkey. With regards to the second question, the main finding of the paper is that dramatic re-arrangements happened in the relative positions of the parties, mostly involving the CHP (the main opposition party) which experienced major shifts in its attitude towards nationalism and new left issues in each of the last two elections. The AKP and the MHP increasingly became more nationalist in successive elections in the 2000s, and all parties put increasingly more emphasis on technocratic issues, reflecting a fierce competition in that field. “A small group of young Turkish patriots who have fallen in love with their country have laid the foundation of MUSIAD 30 years ago”. This passage has been taken from the official Twitter account of MUSIAD whose categorisation has always been a contested issue. MUSIAD has been called the “Anatolian Capital”, “Muslim Bourgeoisie”, “Devout Bourgeoisie”, and finally “patriots who have fall in love with their country”. The uniqueness of this study lays in its class-based approach to the MUSIAD affiliates, as it argues that MUSIAD is composed of three main class fractions which are nationally oriented, internationally oriented and transnational. This categorisation is based on the ways in which MUSIAD affiliates engage in social relations of production rather than matters of religion, culture, and ideology. Subsequently, this study argues that the rise of MUSIAD is part of a process of transformation in the patterns of capital accumulation and uneven development of capitalism in Turkey. Accordingly, this study draws on the uneven and combined development approach to understand why MUSIAD affiliates could not catch up with TUSIAD affiliated companies which mostly represent the transnational fraction of Turkish capital. The Kurdish movement’s decision to operate within and in opposition to the Turkish state reached a peak between 2013 and 2015. Three major events took place during this time period: the launch of the 2013 peace process, the 2014 presidential elections, and the June 2015 general elections. The principal driving force behind these campaigns was an important project put forward by Kurdish activists, which they termed as Türkiyelileşme [Turkeyfication]: an inclusive definition of national identity, which accepted being an integral part of Turkey while at the same time belonging to an ethnic group other than Turkish.Basing the argument on the Kurdish activists’ capacity to combine civil society activism and their promotion of democracy with the articulation of a national identity, this article considers the dynamics of the Kurdish movement along the lines of a “total social movement” between 2013 and 2015. Put forward by the sociologist Alain Touraine, a total social movement is a three-dimensional movement with social, political and national levels of action. It embodies fierce opposition between adversaries, but does not opt for violence no matter what the challenges are. Rather than asking why the Arab Spring has not spread to Algeria, a question that necessitates a comparative approach, this paper will argue that the localised protests that have become a familiar feature of Algerian life for over half a decade respond to Algerian dynamics and have continued to do so in the wake of the Arab Spring. As part of an on-going research project, this paper will use social memory to explore the contradictory nature of Algeria’s past-present relationship, by looking at experiences which at once define what Algerians expect from the state and demobilise energies for collective change. The paper will argue that the fragmented nature of narratives about the past, as well as related generational divides, are factors that have inhibited the growth of cohesive movements demanding political change. In addition, the paper will look critically at assumptions that fears of a return to the violent 1990s are defining reticence toward revolution in Algeria, and will suggest that the riots of October 1988 provide a more useful reference point for understanding the clear lack of enthusiasm for a home-grown Arab Spring. Identifying an Islamic constitutional tradition can be controversial due to orthodox Muslim understandings of God’s sovereignty and agency. Further complicating such discussions are arguments surrounding the compatibility of Muslim traditions with international norms alternately referred to as ‘Western’ or ‘universal’, depending upon one’s political preferences. This comparative examination of Muhammad’s ‘Constitution of Medina’ and the Magna Carta argues that where there is assent and accountability, there is also agency. Just as the relatively spare discussion of rights in the Magna Carta laid the foundations of what would become a far more expansive constitutional tradition in the West, the very existence of Muhammad’s covenant along with the fact that this covenant details specific tribal duties with corresponding rights to societal goods and a vision of the rule of law, indicates that Islamic states can indeed codify and negotiate the challenges of governing, even within the framework of a transcendent law (sharīʿa).

      "87 Objectives. Given the relationship between chronic periodontitis and high levels of oxidative stress, this review aims to clarify what role can played the dietary intake of different antioxidants in maintaining a healthy periodontium and in reducing chronic periodontitis risk, as well as possible use of dietary therapies based on them for this disease treatment. Methods. The database of the National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC (MEDLINE PubMed) was used and all the studies in animals and humans are on the subject of interest in English writing online available from inception of the database until May 2015 were collected. Results. Antioxidants analyzed in this regard include vitamin C, vitamin A, carotenoids and some polyphenols, and coenzyme Q; as well as minerals iron, copper and zinc that are constituents of antioxidant enzymes. Still, there is a paucity of studies with few human studies, mostly observational. Among the various antioxidants, vitamin E and polyphenols seem to have more evidence for its beneficial effect, but in general the studies are insufficient to rule out or establish what antioxidants are useful and which are not. Conclusions. Overall, the data presented indicate that dietary antioxidants are beneficial for periodontal health, at least under certain circumstances. However more studies are needed to establish the relationship between chronic periodontitis and each specific antioxidant and to design useful dietary interventions for this disease management. Objectives. Examine the degree of complexity of pharmacotherapy in chronic patients. Analyze the continuity of medication at hospital admission. Detect the number, nature and impact of medication errors. Evaluate the hospital reconciliation protocol and analyze the contribution of the pharmacist. Methodology. Patients in the areas of internal medicine and surgery were selected for a month. Sources consulted to elaborate the medication history were the medical history and listings of dispensing drugs in unit doses. 48 hours after admission, medication discrepancies and medication errors associated with them were evaluated. The current protocol was examined too. Results. A total of 60 patients were included with an average age of 62.5 ± 17.2 years and 2.7 ± 1.9 per patient chronic diseases. The number of regular medication and during admission per patient was 5.4 ± 2.8 and 6.0 ± 2.9 respectively. 33.5% of the discrepancies were not justified and the average of them per patient was 2.6 ± 2.5. 49.3% of the discrepancies showed potential harm. An average of 1.3 ± 1.9 discrepancies with potential associated harm reached each patient. The medication reconciliation protocol, with the contribution of the pharmacist, was qualified with 94 out of 100 points. Conclusions. Pharmacotherapy of chronic patients is complex in community and hospital services. There is a high number of unjustified discrepancies at admission. Medication reconciliation protocols must be reviewed to obtain quality standards and reduce medication errors. The pharmacist should collaborate in the protocol. Pharmaceutical interventions (PI) are actions performed in the pharmaceutical decisions in therapy of patients and the evaluation of the results, in order to improve the patient’s therapy. Aim. The aim of this study is to describe and develop a methodology to perform and record pharmaceutical interventions (PI) in clinical practice. Material and Methods. A cross-sectional comparative study in two cohorts of pharmaceutical interventions. The study variables are collected in a form designed adapted from two proposals (one Argentina and other Spanish) PI are classified: oriented drugs, administration or medical prescription. Results. 460 were performed in two cohorts, 256 and 194 respectively. 83% of the interventions were focused on the drug; this group was the most frequent PI sequential therapy. This information does not show significant differences between cohorts, we think that the instrument and the method are valid. Acceptance of the PI was on average 95%. The differences between the other groups varied according to the type of prescribed drugs. Conclusions. In both periods the collection instrument allowed the proper registration of the PI conducted. The most common PI was no significant difference between the two cohorts. In all cases the clinical impact was decisive in patient safety. Aim. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers inherent properties have made it the nanocarrier of choice in the current era of innovation. Dendrimer based products are growing and mushrooming like anything in the current time. Although it suffer from hemolytic toxicity which could be reduced by protecting free amino group. Methods. In the present work alternate acetylated method for PAMAM dendrimers was discussed. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide Linker was used for acetylation. The acetylated conjugate was evaluated for color reaction, Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, Differential scanning calorimetric, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra studies. Results. The PAMAM dendrimers were synthesized using divergent approach and further acetylated. Change in λmax values from 282.0 to 282.5 nm was observed for acetylated dendrimers. Characteristic peak of N-H stretch of primary amine at 3284.16 cm-1 was disappeared due to conversion of primary amine to secondary amine. A new peak of –(CO)-NH stretch was obtained at 1640.28 cm-1 (medium) which shows attachment of acetic acid surface group. The changes in Endothermic peak from 120.56 to 110.400C were observed which shows the PAMAM dendrimers surface modifications The peak of –NH2 at 2.99 ppm was replaced by (–NHCOCH3) at 2.42 ppm further supports the proof of acetylation. Conclusions. The spectral data clearly revealed that this approach for acetylation gives considerable amount of acetylation in less time duration with elimination of organic solvent. This method could be employed for regular acetylation of amine terminated nanocarriers. EDC linker mediated capping of amine groups opened a new avenue for acetylation of amine terminated protein/peptides. Introduction. The improper use of restricted antibiotics (ATBr) in the hospital environment, currently constitute a major health problem. Their indiscriminate use and the absence of oversight by specialists in infectious diseases, are contributing to an accelerated selection of resistant strains, which translates into an increasingly smaller therapeutic arsenal. Objective. To analyze the right or wrong indication of restricted antibiotics in our hospital, according to the primary diagnosis. Material and methods. Observational and descriptive study of a series of 126 consecutive cases analyzed over six months, in which we reviewed both stories clinics as requests for restricted antibiotics. Results. The 61.11% of patients who are prescribed an ATBr had been treated prior and a 19.84% the ATBr were prescribed home. The 73% remaining prescriptions were inadequate or incomplete. Aim. The main aim of this review article is to provide information like advantages of protein and peptides via different routes of drug administration, targeted to a particular site and its implication in drug delivery system. Methods. To that aim, from the web sites of PubMed, HCAplus, Thomson, and Registry were used as the main sources to perform the search for the most significant research articles published on the subject. The information was then carefully analyzed, highlighting the most important results in the development of protein and peptide drug targeting as well as its therapeutic activity. Results. In recent years many researchers use protein and peptide as a target site of drug by a different delivery system. Proteins and peptides are used as specific and effective therapeutic agents, due to instability and side effects their use is complicated. Protein kinases are important regulators of most, if not all, biological processes. Abnormal activity of proteins and peptides has been implicated in many human diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Conclusions. It is concluded that the protein and peptide were used in drug targeting to specific site and also used in different diseased states like cancer, diabetes, immunomodulating, neurodegenerative effects and antimicrobial activity. Objectives. Currently the skin aging is very important in the cosmetic field. For this reason, in this work a review about the skin aging is made. Therefore, our work focuses on the different theories that explain the skin aging as well as the causes that can induce this aging. In addition the compounds used in its treatment are studies, both from the point of view of preventive cosmetics as products used as repairmen. Methods. To carry out this work were used different database as the National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC (MEDLINE PubMed) and a lot of interesting information available online. Results. Different compounds are analyzed from a preventive and reparative used. It is observed how the use of many of them can have a dual action, and these compounds can be used with a hydrating and antioxidant purpose moreover the effects taken may be varied and with different intensity. Therefore proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, peptides, melatonin and DHEA, two hormones recently used, are studied. Among the analyzed antioxidants, vitamin E and polyphenols seem to be more evidence that supporting their beneficial effect. Conclusions. The combination of several cosmetic compounds is a factor to be taken into account. In this sense, the future of anti-aging treatment may depend of a previous genetic study and the development of appropriate formulation for each type of skin. However more studies are needed to substantiate the concept of genocosmetic. Objetives. Flavonoids have been proposed to exert beneficial effects in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In this review we try to clarify some fundamental questions regarding efficacy, mechanism of action and bioavailability of one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in the diet, quercetin. Methods. The database of the National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC (MEDLINE PubMed) was used and all the studies in animals and humans available from inception of the database until November 2015 were collected. Results. Quercetin exerts vasodilatory and antihypertensive effects in animal models of hypertension and hypertensive subjets. Quercetin is effective in all models of hypertension analyzed, independently of the origin of the hypertension, the status of renin–angiotensin system, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, and other factors. Paradoxically, despite exerting biologically demonstrable systemic effects, it is not found in plasma after oral administration and its circulating metabolites show weak activity in vitro. Quercetin is extensively metabolized into methylated and glucurono- and sulfo-conjugated metabolites, which are the plasma circulating forms; and glucurono-, but not sulfo-conjugates, can be hydrolyzed at the vascular level, yielding the parent aglycone which accumulates in tissues. Thus conjugation is a reversible process and, at least regarding the vasodilator and antihypertensive effects, the conjugation-deconjugation cycle appears to be an absolute requirement. Conclusions. Glucuronidated derivatives transport quercetin and its methylated form, and deliver to the tissues the free aglycone, which is the final effector. Objectives. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and generate high health costs. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the treatments which produce more ADRs in general population and the main symptoms they generate. Methods. An observational, cross-sectional study consisting in performing a self-rated questionnaire was carried out. 510 patients were asked about the treatments, illnesses and ADRs, they had suffered from. Results. 26.7% of patients had suffered from some ADR. Classifying patients according to the type of prescribed treatment and studying the number of ADR that they had, we obtained significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) for treatments against arthrosis, anemia and nervous disorders (anxiety, depression, insomnia). Moreover, determining absolute frequencies of these ADRs appearance in each treatment, higher frequencies were again for drugs against arthrosis (22.6% of patients treated for arthrosis suffered some ADR), anemia (14.28%), nerve disorders (13.44%) and also asthma (16%). Regarding the symptoms produced by ADRs, the most frequent were gastrointestinal (60% of patients who suffered an ADR, had gastrointestinal symptoms) and nervous alterations (dizziness, headache, sleep disturbances etc) (24.6%). Conclusion. Therapeutic groups which produce more commonly ADRs are those for arthrosis, anemia, nervous disorders and asthma. In addition, symptoms which are generated more frequently are gastrointestinal and nervous problems. This is in accordance with the usual side effects of mentioned treatments. Health professionals should be informed about it, so that they would be more alert about a possible emergence of an ADR in these treatments. They also could provide enough information to empower patients and thus, they probably could detect ADR events. This would facilitate ADR detection and would avoid serious consequences generated to both patients’ health and health economics. Objectives. To uncover reasons why patients missed pharmaceutical care (PC) appointments, identify predictive\n",
      "88 This paper examined the practices of news and source usage in Ethiopian Television (ETV). It assessed news and source selection criteria of the media organization. The study also focused on the major source of news and speakers in the news. Besides, factors affecting news and source selection was also another objective of the study. The study used mixed research method. As a result, quantitative content analysis and an in-depth interview were used as tools of data gathering. It employed purposive sampling to select key informants for the study. For the media content sample, the study focused on ETV’s prime time news at 8:00 PM. The findings of the study showed that the major criteria of news selection in ETV were based on the value of the news in building the image of the government. Sources of the news were government officials. The majority of the speakers in the news production by ETV staff reporters were government officials, especially those found at federal level. It was also found that there is lack of journalistic independence in the media. Journalists were influenced to report the positive sides of government and conceal the wrong doings of government officials. Therefore, in the way to the truth as diversified views are very crucial, Ethiopian Television should take the necessary measure to treat varies views in its news stories. The present paper aims to assess the student satisfaction of Jimma University, College of Social Sciences and Humanities. The satisfaction level of students with teaching and learning service and the factors affecting the satisfaction level of students of the college were the key objectives. Questionnaire and focus group discussion were used to gather the necessary data from the respondents. A closed questionnaire containing 38 items categorized in four sections has been used. These questions were related with academic staff, academic advising/mentorship, assessments, and student services. Besides, ten (10) representative students from the college were purposively selected for focus group discussions. A Likert-type response scale has been employed to measure the data gathered through questionnaires. SPSS software has been used for data analysis of the questionnaire. General survey guided by well-structured questionnaire through simple random sampling has been administered across a sample of 317 students. The collected data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively and the finding of the study indicated that there is moderate satisfaction level of students with the services that were delivered by the college. Therefore, it is recommended that the college authorities should take the necessary measures in order to increase the students’ satisfaction level. This study investigates the relationship between organisational socialization and employee spontaneous behaviour of Nigerian airline operators using cross sectional survey from seventy five employees of selected five airline operators. Sample size of sixty three was ascertained using Krejcie and Morgan. Face validity was employed while cronbach alpha was used to ascertain the reliability of the instrument. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (rs) was used to analyse the hypotheses with the aid of SPSS (20.0). The study found that organisational socialization has positive significant relationship with employee spontaneous behaviour. It concluded that organisational socialization measured in terms of anticipatory socialization, encounter socialization and metamorphosis socialization enhances employee spontaneous behaviour of Nigeria airlines. One of the recommendations of the study is that; airline operators should take socialization of newcomers seriously to enhance spontaneous behaviour in the workplace. While several scholar had drew their study focusing on the role of media into conflict management, Hume et al. (2014) few have pay to attention to the types, levels, and phases of the conflict, Hyland and Makowsky (2006). Looking to fulfill the research gap, this study was aimed to investigate the effect of media into conflict management focusing on the level of media. Israel and Palestine conflict was used as a case study and to frame the analysis, the research data were collected through a series of questionnaires. As concluded by Kim, Amouzegar, and Ao 2016), local media are a potential tool deescalating in global conflict, our finding show that local media are source of peace building and conflict deescalating however international media interfere into conflict management according to his national interest and as an instrument of influencing foreign policy to the parties involve. We finally concluded that the current and future relationship and level of tension between Israel and Palestine can be predicted by Al jazera. Ghana could be described as an island of peace in an ocean of conflicts. This is because most of Ghana’s West African neighbours have experienced (and some are still experiencing) various forms of national civil conflicts which have never occurred in Ghana. In the last three decades, the West Africa sub-region has been plagued with many intra-state conflicts. In Liberia, Sierra-Leone, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali, conflicts have escalated into full scale war, bringing with it numerous loss of lives, destruction of property and causing social despair for the citizenry. The peace of some countries like Senegal, Nigeria, Niger and recently Burkina Faso also continues to be threatened by different dissident groups and popular uprisings. While most of these countries’ democracies remain fragile due to the conflicts within these states, Ghana remains one of few examples whose current democratic structures have stood the test of time for the last three decades. This study inquired into Ghana’s conflict resistance capacities and its ability to continue to sustain its democracy as a country. Mixed methods approach was employed to select 132 community residents from 3 purposefully sampled conflict-prone communities in Ghana, and 5 key informants as well as 462 political party delegates for interviewing and data collection for the study.The study found that the very nature of Ghana’s internal conflicts with respect to their geographical limitations, the conflict parties involved as well as the issues at stake contribute to confine these internal conflicts within their areas of occurrence. In addition, some conscious social and institutional measures (put in place) in the Ghanaian democratic system help to promote peace and maintain order. Finally, majority of the respondents (63.6%) were of the opinion that Ghana is unlikely to have a national civil war because its democratic institutions are effective. It was suggested that politicians should avoid interfering in local conflicts and increase coverage for peace education programmes and conflict intervention initiatives in the country, among others. The period between to 13th century AD and 16th century AD is very crucial in the political history of South India general and especially in the history of Andhrapradesh. Because the first part of the 14th century (1323 AD) witnessed the Muslim invasions which cast for the rise of revolts by the federated of the chief Kakatiyas to liberated Andhradesa from the Muslim leaders when the Andhra region caught in political disturbances. It impact on the socio-economic spheres of the period, the conditions of trade and commerce became a setback. After freed the Andhradesa from the Muslim conquers, the socio-economic conditions became slowly as use well. Naturally the trade and commerce especially internal &amp; external trade with foreign countries slowly gained economic profits the trade and merchant guilds were also moved towards in progress. So the present paper is focussed on a brief study of trade guilds in Andhra (1300 AD to 1600 AD) is discussed briefly. Ethics have a verifiable effect on the validity and economic supportability of quantity studying practices and additionally influencing the individual security of the profession. There is a developing consent inside and outside the construction industry that unscrupulous practices are endemic in the construction industry especially quantity surveying practice in Nigeria. This paper thusly, x-rayed the outcomes of unethical practices by Quantity Surveyors in the construction industry in Nigeria, and likewise displays more scholarly and practical approach in dealing with moral appraisal of Quantity Surveyors in the construction industry and ways to improve moral standard among them. Very much organized polls (questionnaire) were self-administered to stakeholders and professionals in construction organizations. Literature review also revealed that unethical practices result to dissatisfied clients, late compensation due to delays, low productivity/efficiency of project team, deterioration in professionalism, poor workmanship, high maintenance, upward review of contract cost, poor project coordination, poor quality infrastructure development, stunted growth of the industry, reduction in the life span of building, loss of public trust, conflicts between client and construction team, poor quality of infrastructural development and loss of public trust. Data were collected and analyzed using Mean Item Score (MIS) and Standard Deviation (SD). The results shows that dissatisfaction of clients, High maintenance cost and Poor workmanship were perceived to be the major ethical misconduct by Quantity Surveyors in the construction industry. The study recommended that Quantity Surveyors should not always make financial benefits, other advantages as their real concern and gain cash unethically by all means. Others professionals in the industry ought to dependably be caution and endeavor not to keep any untrustworthy conduct among themselves. Major client in Nigeria construction industry, which is the government need to be fair to the Quantity Surveyors and other professionals in the construction industry. Developing the competence to use information technology in teaching is one of the important occupational competencies for teachers in the digital age. Information technology application development has many implications in promoting the training process to train and develop students, in accordance with the actual conditions of education in Vietnam and the general trend of the world is essential.Research paper on needs assessment using information technology of teachers in online teaching, proposing the process of identifying the structure of information technology competencies and requirements for capacity development to use information technology in online teaching of training institutions. The parameters in this paper present an empirical research result to address the need to develop the information technology application competence in online teaching, necessary to successful organize online teaching with a variety of theoretical and practical pedagogies in technology in education. This study examines the trends, composition, and intensity of Nigeria-China bilateral trade for the period, 1992-2016. Tables, graphs, and trade intensity formula were used. The results show that Nigeria’s trade with China has considerably recorded remarkable growth. With the exception of mineral fuels and products of their distillation, the share of major products exported to China over the period remained insignificant. More importantly, the results reveal that the share of major products imported from China remained significant, indicating that Chinese exports supply to Nigeria is more diversified than that of Nigeria\\'s exports supply to China. Nigeria’s trade intensity index shows a low possibility of increasing export to China and a high possibility of increasing import from China. In the case of China, there is exists a high possibility of increasing its export and decreasing its import to and from Nigeria. Based on the study’s findings, the study recommends an urgent need for Nigeria\\'s government to encourage the export of various products in order to promote bilateral trade and mitigate the existing trade imbalance. The study further recommends the need for government, researchers, and export promotion agencies to identify new market opportunities for Nigeria\\'s exports in the Chinese market. The presence of PT. Eternal Light Television (TATV) as local television in Surakarta and surrounding there initially, viewed pessimistically by the surrounding community. This is very reasonable considering that no television has been established in Surakarta. On April 29, 2004, TATV began broadcasting on air, and was called \\\"Jelang Tayang Perdana\\\". At the start of launching on air or the trial broadcast by TATV it still seemed to be less professional. There are no programs that can be presented such as national television, only limited to advertisements in the form of slides. The screenings are still very simple and not very interesting. In addition to image quality, it may be due to the lack of human resource management.At first, TATV only broadcast for 3 hours and the ShowTime is still limited to daylight hours. After conducting a grand launch on September 1, 2004, TATV began broadcasting for 8 hours per day. After surviving several months with broadcasts for 8 hours per day in subsequent developments, TATV then began pursuing\n",
      "89 This paper is intended to describe the design and manufacturing aspects of a simple micromachined capacitive pressure sensor working in the pressure range of 0-1000 mbar. 500 µm thick Borofloat® 33 glass and silicon wafers were used as substrates. The basic transducer structure consists of a rectangular silicon membrane as deformable electrode and a fix aluminum electrode formed on the glass surface. In order to determine the exact geometry of the silicon electrode structure numerical models and simulations were applied. The thin silicon membrane was fabricated by Si bulk micromachining, i.e. anisotropic alkaline etching with electrochemical etch-stop. The two wafers were bonded together at low temperature by anodic bonding. After bonding and dicing the wafers the pressure sensors were characterized mechanically and functionally also. Our results demonstrate the functional behavior of the manufactured sensor structures and provide excellent verification of the preliminary expectations based on theoretical calculations and electro-mechanical simulations. The reliability investigation of the lead-free solders is still a current issue. In this paper, Electrochemical Migration (ECM) behavior of novel lead-free micro-alloyed low Ag content solders were investigated by water drop test in NaCl solution. The results were compared to commonly used lead-free and lead bearing solder alloys. It was found that some micro-alloyed solders can have similar low ECM susceptibility than lead bearing ones. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was also carried out to find the root cause of different ECM behaviour of micro-alloyed solders. The results of water drop test and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were in good agreement relating electrochemical migration susceptibility. Since SAC0807 solder alloy has shown higher corrosion rate than SAC0307 and has also higher ability for ECM as well. It is concluded, that some lead-free micro-alloyed low Ag content solder alloy (e.g.: SAC0807) could have a high reliability risk in the electronic devices during operation. This paper deals with corner detection of simple geometric objects in quantized range images. Low depth resolution and noise introduce challenges in edge and corner detection. Corner detection and classification is based on layer by layer depth data extraction and morphologic operations. Appearance based heuristics are applied to identify different corner types defined in this paper. Both computer generated and captured range images are dealt with. Synthetic range images have arbitrary range resolution while captured images are based on the sensor used. Real world data is collected using a structured light based sensor to provide dense range map. The purpose of our study is to prove that eliminating bone shadows from chest radiographs can greatly improve the accuracy of automated lesion detection. To free images from rib and clavicle shadows, they are first segmented using a dynamic programming approach. The segmented shadows are eliminated in difference space. The cleaned images are processed by a hybrid lesion detector based on gradient convergence, contrast and intensity statistics. False findings are eliminated by a Support Vector Machine. Our method can eliminate approximately 80% of bone shadows (84% for posterior part) with an average segmentation error of 1 mm. With shadow removal the number of false findings dropped from 2.94 to 1.23 at 63% of sensitivity for cancerous tumors. The output of the improved system showed much less dependence on bone shadows. Our findings show that putting emphasis on bone shadow elimination can lead to great benefits for computer aided detection. The failure of safety-critical embedded systems may have catastrophic consequences, therefore their development process requires a strong verification procedure to obtain a high confidence of correctness in the specification and implementation. Formal modelling and model checking provides a rigorous, mathematically precise verification method. Practical embedded systems are typically complex, distributed and asynchronous, thus they need expressive and compact formal models, and efficient model checking approaches. The saturation algorithm has an efficient iteration strategy. Combined with symbolic data structures, it can be used for state space generation and model checking of asynchronous systems. Coloured Petri nets are a good choice for modelling distributed and asynchronous systems, however their integration with saturation has not been solved in the past. In this paper we describe a new approach for applying saturation-based state space generation and model checking to coloured Petri nets. We demonstrate the performance of our new algorithm on the verification of a safety function used in the Reactor Protection System of a nuclear power plant. In wireless sensor networks developed for ambient assisted living (AAL) applications, power supply is one of the most challenging problems. In the case when measurements have low cost; a method is proposed for decreasing the time of communication by handling the measured data locally. In AAL applications the position tracking of a person is an essential task. Position tracking with motion sensors requires high number of messages and most of them are caused by local movements. Our suggestion is to eliminate these messages. The method is based on Hidden Markov Model of the motions of an observed person. The model provides information based on the estimated global state of the system, which is the position of the person in the space of interest. This state can be forwarded to the nodes so they locally perform the filtering to save valuable energy by not transmitting messages which are not relevant. The application of Bayesian network based methods is increasingly popular in several research fields where the investigation of complex dependency patterns are of central importance. Bayesian networks provide a rich, graph-based language for the refined characterization of relevance types, and has a built-in mechanism for the correction of multiple testing. In the paper we discuss two main topics: the effects of priors and the applicability of Bayesian structure based odds ratio. The selection of an adequate prior is generally required by Bayesian methods and yet there is no general method for prior selection in the multivariate case. Here we analyze the effects of different priors and propose a method for prior selection based on expected effect size. In the second part of the paper we investigate structural and parametric aspects of relevance, and demonstrate a hybrid effect size measure that allows an integrated analysis of these aspects. This paper explores novel, polynomial time, heuristic, approximate solutions to the NP-hard problem of finding the optimal job schedule on identical machines which minimizes total weighted tardiness (TWT). We map the TWT problem to quadratic optimization and demonstrate that the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) can successfully solve it. Furthermore, the solution can be significantly sped up by choosing the initial state of the HNN as the result of a known simple heuristic, we call this Smart Hopfield Neural Network (SHNN). We also demonstrate, through extensive simulations, that by considering random perturbations to the Largest Weighted Process First (LWPF) and SHNN methods, we can introduce further improvements to the quality of the solution, we call the latter Perturbed Smart Hopfield Neural Network (PSHNN). Finally, we argue that due to parallelization techniques, such as the use of GPGPU, the additional cost of these improvements is small. Numerical simulations demonstrate that PSHNN outperforms HNN in over 99% of all randomly generated cases by an average of 3-7%, depending on the problem size. On a specific, large scale scheduling problem arising in computational finance at Morgan Stanley, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, PSHNN produced a 5% improvement over the next best heuristic. Web services provide platform independent communication through an XML-based standard family. The major software vendors released their own SOA products implementing these standards. However, the configuration of the WS-* protocols differs from product to product. Matching these configurations between different products can be a very tedious task. Security protocols are among the most complicated protocols to configure, especially if access control is also required. Although the XACML standard aims to solve this task, its rules and policies described in XML are not very user friendly, and XACML has a very poor support in the major SOA products. Therefore, we have developed a platform independent metamodel for describing distributed systems of web services. From models described in this metamodel the platform specific configurations and program codes can be easily generated for the various SOA products, increasing the productivity of the development. This article introduces an access control extension to this metamodel. Mass points are very useful objects not only in physics but also in geometry. There are several ways to approach the mathematics of mass points. In this paper we give an independent interpretation. We define kantor space and kantors as the elements of it. We prove that this is a vector space and give a short overview of the types of bases and the connections between them. One of our important tools is the symmetric distance formula for kantors, which expresses the distance of two points in terms of their kantric coordinates. We introduce the kantric scalar product, which allows us to prove easily the existence of an orthogonal point and give a formula of the radius of the circumscribed sphere of affinely independent set of points, which is our main result. A new approach of nonholonomic path planning for car-like robots is presented. The main idea is similar to many existing approaches which obtain a path in two phases. It is familiar in nonholonomic planning that at first a holonomic path is planned which is approximated by a nonholonomic one in a second step by subdividing it into smaller parts and replacing them with local paths fulfilling the kinematic constraints. These methods mostly rely on probabilistic methods and heuristic optimization. Our approach uses a holonomic preliminary path as well, but it serves only as a \\\"loose guidance\\\" to the second phase of the planning process. The final path is not required to contain any of the intermediate points of the preliminary path at all. The method is effective in environments consisting of narrow corridors but having wider free areas as well which can be used for maneuvering.\n",
      "90 Agricultural work is an inherently dangerous job with the risk of injury considered part of a worker’s compensation. We focus on the determinants of an agricultural day laborer (jornalero) having experienced an injury while working. The policy variable of interest is the worker’s level of educational attainment as workers with a higher level may be better able to understand how equipment works and safety warnings. Controlling for other factors, we find that at the variable means, a jornalero with an additional year of education has a 7.7 percent lower probability of having experienced an accident. The present study analyzes the possible impact for a person of having obesity or overweight in the Mexican labor market. In specific, this article focuses the analysis studying the impact of these conditions, over wages and over the probability of finding a job, using two measures of obesity: the body mass index and the waist-height ratio. The results show, that once the selectivity bias is taken into consideration, for men there are no wage differentials neither in favor nor against men with obesity or overweight. We found evidence of wage differentials in favor of women with obesity and overweight in some groups (in certain education levels). For employment, we do not find difference in the probabilities of employment among the analyzed groups, once that we control for the possibility of gaining weight after being employed. Advocacy for decentralization has grown in Mexico at a rapid pace during the last decade. The gains of decentralization, however, are rather unclear and many times the assumptions and the outcomes of the process depart from the standard theory of fiscal federalism. There are serious drawbacks that should be considered before fully endorsing any decentralization program. As decentralization has progressed in Mexico, for instance, it has become evident that most of Mexican states have incurred in large fiscal deficits, majorly due to excessive overspending. This paper explains the reasons why such a trend has been observed in recent years based on a simultaneous equation model of state revenues and expenditures. The results suggest that increases in fiscal deficits are significantly associated with more intense political competition at the subnational sphere, the stage of the political business cycle, and fiscal perversity caused by political decentralization. This implies that regions expect to be bailed out by the federal government in case of financial trouble and thus do not have an incentive to observe fiscal discipline. Keywords: decentralization, fiscal perversity, Mexico.Clasificación JEL: H72, H77, R51. Utilizing a unique sample of 253 microenterprise border retailers from El Paso, Texas, this paper explores the possibility of cash payment from cross-border shoppers using Mexican pesos. We find that one-fifth of microenterprise retailers in El Paso accept payment in Mexican pesos. Increased peso acceptance rates are associated with retailer proximity to Mexico and business segment in which the retailers compete. El Paso microenterprises are also more likely than their medium- to large-business counterparts to allow payments to be made using Mexican pesos. The opportunity cost of currency substitution is examined for accepting and yet-to-accept firms. JEL Classification: M21, F31, D22. This article analyzes the contribution of technology-intensive activities to the increase in aggregate labor productivity in the industrial sector for a set of 28 countries, dividing 150 industrial classes into four groups based on their degree of technology content (High, Medium-High, Medium-Low, and Low). After decomposing the evolution of labor productivity with a statistical method, it was found that these activities did not contribute significantly to the increase in the efficiency indicator. These exercises also corroborate the absence of a global structural change in the industry that would drive levels of aggregate labor productivity. One of the most studied hypotheses in the last decades within the economy of natural resources is “the resource curse”, which suggests that natural resource abundance leads to lower growth rates. This paper links the relationship of abundance and dependence of natural resources with economic growth and social welfare, considering also the institutional quality. The main findings are (i) the evidence against the resource curse, when we use a proxy variable of resource abundance different to that one used in several related works; in this study, this variable used by other authors, is treated as an endogenous variable and it measures resource dependence and (ii) the positive effect of natural resources on economic development, even though diffuse resources have a bigger effect than the point resources. The methods of estimation are 2SLS and 3SLS. We estimated the progressive, structural synchronization of the Mexican growth cycle with that of the US (total and industrial) for 1980.1-2013.4. By applying the Quandt-Andrews (1993) and Bai-Perron (2003) unknown-breakpoint tests, we identified that before 1994.4 there was no statistically significant relationship between the Mexican GDP growth cycle and the US industrial output cycle, but a weak (statistically significant) relationship with total US GDP cycle. However, since 1997.4 and particularly since 2001.2, there is a vast and increasing synchronization and determination from the US industrial cycle to the Mexican cycle (R2 = 0.96). The degrees of freedom of Mexican domestic economic policy have thus drastically decreased. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the consequences of two alternative ways of raising funds to finance poverty alleviation programs in Mexico: A Value Added Tax (VAT) reform and a personal income tax reform (IT). The impact of the reforms is analyzed with an applied general equilibrium model of the Mexican economy, calibrated using a 1996 Social Accounting Matrix. The model includes 18 production sectors, 10 representative households, the government, and the rest of the world. The cash transfers required to attain a fixed increase in the Equivalent Variation (EV) of the lowest income households are obtained either increasing effective VAT rates or IT rates. When all rates are scaled up by the same factor, the VAT reform generates a positive global EV considerably larger than the one obtained scaling the IT rates, though the latter diminishes (increases) lower (higher) income households’ contribution. Setting a uniform VAT rate results in a positive global EV considerably larger than the one obtained with a uniform IT. Moreover, the distribution gap increases in the latter case since the richest households receive the largest benefits. Clasificación JEL: D58, I32, I38. The paper analyzes the Thirlwall’s Law for Mexico during 1993-2014. It includes unit roots and cointegration tests that incorporate endogenous structural breaks. The cointegration vector in the theoretical context suggests growth is constrained by the balance of payments in Mexico. The economic growth rate for the period is greater than the balance of payments equilibrium growth rate, what implied trade deficit. The results suggest a structural change to discourage imports and add value to exports. This paper analyses the existence of long memory in the major stock markets in the world, and if this is the case, whether it’s due to the type of econometric models used, the period of study or the frequency of data (intraday, daily, weekly, etc.)? To do this, we perform a comparative analysis between the empirical results of ARFIMA and GARCH models. The stock markets that showed consistent results of long memory, regardless of the method, the period and the frequency were China and South Korea. The first one exhibits long memory, and the other a short one. This study was conducted with two objectives: determining the productive sectors that are vulnerable to possible limitations in the availability of groundwater and estimating a shadow price that reflects the importance of the resource in the regional economic system. In order to achieve these goals, we estimated value added water indices and water shadow prices that are based on the regional input-output table (RIOT) 2003. The results indicate that agriculture, livestock, food, electrical and power generation products are vulnerable, while trade and services are less not vulnerable. Regarding the shadow, price yields a value of $ 4 to $ 14.96 pesos per m3 for general use and $ 28 to $ 104.71 for industrial and commercial use.\n",

      "92 Ozone generator system using negative coronas was fabricated to produce ozone gas and ozonated water of varying concentration. The generated ozone air will be emitted to the water through bubble diffuser or venturi injection depending on the input air mass transfer rate. The concentration of ozonated water was examined using both ozone test strip and schoenbein paper. The efficiency of ozone gas in microorganism treatment is verified through the lowest number of microorganism’s colony available compared with other treatment methods. The half-life of ozonated water in this study was improved by increasing the transfer rate of water and solubility of ozone in water. Concentration of ozonated water was found increased through the application of pressurized oxygen input gas. Thoracic trunk shift and Coronal balance are main features to be considered while planning treatment for scoliosis patients. Thoracic trunk shift refers to deviation of trunk from its normal position. Coronal balance refers to deviation of seventh cervical bone from sacrum in coronal plane. After undergoing scoliosis correction surgery, these two parameters are measured by surgeons using radiograph images to make sure the scoliosis curve progression is stopped and whether vertebral alignment is back to normal. Since the relationship between thoracic trunk shift and coronal balance in the post-operated scoliotic patients is questionable, this study is done to find the correlation between thoracic trunk shift and coronal balance in the thoracic scoliosis patients who underwent correction surgery at least a year before from the date of taking radiographs. Radiographs of 24 patients were collected. Statistical analysis was done using paired sample ‘t’ test, with ‘p\\' value of 0.05 as the level of significance. The mean millimetre measurement of thoracic trunk shift and coronal balance was found to be 27.62 mm and 10.50 mm. Results of our study showed that there is a 10.18% of relation in between the post thoracic trunk shift and coronal balance of those 24 patients. Oil palm frond is known to be the largest contributor to the oil palm residues, providing up to 50.3% of the total residues. Since it had a very limited utility, an initiative was taken by this study to investigate its suitability for bio-oil production. Hence, slow pyrolysis was conducted in an experimental setup equipped with a fixed bed reactor and a liquid collection system. From the experiments, the effect of reaction temperature on the bio-oil yield was examined. The characteristics of the obtained bio-oil were also investigated to study its potential as a substitute of phenol. It was found that at reaction temperature of 375 °C, highest yield of bio-oil was obtained at 38.4 wt%. Meanwhile, the characteristics of oil palm frond and its bio-oil were found to be approximately similar to the characteristics of typical softwoods and their bio-oil. Most softwood biomass has been successfully used as a phenol substitute. Therefore, the potential of this bio-oil to be used as a phenol substitute was enhanced. The objective of the study is to analyse the phytochemical content by quantitative and qualitative methods and to investigate the antioxidant properties on Clinacanthus nutans leaves and stems from different areas: Yik Poh Ling (YPL) un-shaded sample (exposed to direct sunlight) and You Dun Chao (YDC) un-shaded and shaded (with black shade netting) samples. Extracts were prepared by dissolving fine powder of C. nutans in 1:10 solvent using ultrasonic extraction for an hour. Preliminary screening and quantitative estimation of phytochemical (alkaloids, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, steroids, terpenoids, phenols and tannins) analysis were conducted. Then, determination of antioxidant properties (total phenolic content, TPC, ferric reducing/ antioxidant power, FRAP and radical-scavenging activities, DPPH) were conducted. All the samples contained alkaloids, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, steroids, terpenoids, phenols and tannins. Un-shaded leaves of C. nutans from YDC exhibited significantly higher result in antioxidant properties (966.00mg GAE/g of dried sample in TPC, 20.44mg TE/g of dried sample in FRAP and 11.14mg TE/g of dried sample in DPPH) than the other samples (p &lt; 0.05). As a conclusion, C. nutans has a good potential to be an alternative antioxidant source. Surfactants are important class of material used in latexes to impart stability at the solid/liquid interface. Ionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants are known to provide electrostatic and steric stabilization. In this study, two surfactants having chain length of twelve hydrocarbons were added to the natural rubber latex (NRL) respectively to determine its zeta potential values, adsorption isotherm and rheological properties. The zeta potential magnitude of NRL in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate increased as its concentration increases, while polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether did not show a significant change in zeta potential. The isotherms were of Langmuir Type 1, the amount of surfactant adsorbed per unit area at the plateau region was 6.0 &nbsp;10-6 mol m-2 for sodium dodecyl sulphate and 2.1 &nbsp;10-6 mol m-2 for polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether. The elastic modulus and relative viscosity of the NRL suspensions increased significantly in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate and also with polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether as compared to the NRL system. The maximum packing volume fractions of the NRL stabilized with sodium dodecyl sulphate and polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether were found to be lower than NRL itself. Medical emergency on board is a new phenomenon which is a lack of attention. Despite the presence of cabin crew who is certified to provide medical care to the passenger, failure to acquire the non-technical skills and low level of knowledge and technical skills retention is reported to be major challenges in developing a high competence cabin crew in providing effective medical care. Knowing how to develop simulations, integrate them into teaching, and effectively assess simulated performance is becoming a core role for educators in healthcare. For many educators, a knowledge and skill gap exists between the demand for simulation learning and competence in developing and using simulation. This article shares a three-step train-the-trainer model to prepare aviation educators to use simulation effectively in the context of non-medical community. The steps include identification, development, and integration with an additional follow up evaluation. The barriers and challenges faced in implementing the model are outlined together with the implication for future application. This model is an effective approach for developing a trained educator in first aid for aviation integrated with simulation learning. The trained educator can then become a pioneer and train other organizations. Nowadays, numbers of the wild harvested horseshoe crab that used in study are increasing. However, general information of horseshoe crabs behaviours in captivity during holding period are still scanty. The aims of this study are to provide the information of the satiation, feeding period and defecation pattern of Tachypleus gigas (Müller, 1785) during the rearing period by introducing the crabs with gastropod, crustacean and bivalve in several percentage; 0.2%, 0.6%, 1.0%, 1.4%, 1.8% and 2.2% expressed of crabs’ body weight. The defecation of crabs was monitored for every three hrs after being fed to measure their gut transit time and defecation pattern. Male crabs did not significantly eat until two weeks in captivity while, females started to eat during the early first week after being harvested from the wild. The satiation levels of females (gastropod: 1.8%±0.04; crustacean: 1.7%±0.08; bivalve: 1.8%±0.06) were significantly higher than male (gastropod: 1.7%±0.08; crustacean: 1.4%±0.02; bivalve: 1.6%±0.05) for all feed types. Gut transit time of males were significantly longer than females. Male crabs took shorter time (1±0 hr) to achieve their satiation than female crabs (2±0 hrs). This study explained how the feeding of horseshoe crabs takes the form they do and for designing a better rearing procedure. Information on tropical horseshoe crabs, Tachypleus gigas (Müller, 1785) feeding behaviour and preference feed of the are still scanty compared to work on Limulus polyphemus (Linnaeus, 1758). Conditions of foods substantially influence their edibility. However, horseshoe crabs might have specific behaviour to manipulate the foraged food. The aim of this paper is to investigate the feeding mechanism of T. gigas toward different feed conditions. Experiments were done inside a glass aquarium. We introduced 30 males and females respectively to five different natural potential feeds, namely, gastropods (Turritella sp.), crustacean (Squilla sp.), fish (Lates calcarifer), bivalve (Meretrix meretrix) and polychaete (Nereis sp.). We had manipulated the condition of introduced feed based on the several potential foods conditions in nature such as, sheltered (protected with shell, hard outer skin or host tube), unsheltered and decayed before introduced the feeds to the crabs. In present study, female crabs took shorter response period toward surrounding feed compared to males. Overall, they prefer to consume freshly dead feeds and would totally reject the sheltered feeds, such as, shell, hard outer skin and tube host. Male crabs have particular feeding behaviours to manipulate the edibility of the decayed feeds. Detailed experiments on the feeding behaviour and preference feed of horseshoe crabs could provide more information on their foraging activity in the wild. Oxidative stress (oxs) has been implicated in various diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis as it can alter cellular components in body. Oxidative stress can be neutralized by anti-oxidative compounds found in many natural products such as berries, turmeric and even figs. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of figs. Fig or its scientific name Ficus carica (FC) is one of the fruits mentioned in the Quran and is known among the Malays as ‘buah tin’. Electronic databases used were Scopus, Ovid, Proquest and Science Direct. The inclusion criteria were studies that utilized the fresh, dried, juice, extract of FC written in English, published within 2007 to 2017, studies carried out in tissue culture and animal studies. Anti-oxidative effect, lipid peroxidation inhibition and anti-inflammatory were the key outcomes in this review. A total of 19 studies met all the criteria. The results showed that treatment with FC increased anti-oxidative enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and decreased lipid peroxidation activity. FC also reported to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α in acute and chronic inflammation. In conclusion, Ficus carica exhibited anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. The adverse effects of prolonged and rampant usage of chemical insecticides in controlling the population of vector arthropod have received many public attention worldwide. In many part of the world, heavily use of chemical insecticide have caused the development of resistance among&nbsp; vector populations as well as non target organism. Thus, has urged the need on the exploitation of alternative insecticides particularly from plant sources. In view of this, the present study screened the role of larvicidal activities of methanol extracts of leaf and stem of Jacaranda mimosifolia Don (Family: Bignoniaceae), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Family: Myrtaceae), Tabebuia chrysantha (Jacq.) Nicholson (Family: Bignoniaceae), Tabebuia pallida (Lindl.) Miers (Family: Bignoniaceae) and Tabebuia rosea Toll (Family: Bignoniaceae) against dengue vectors, Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae) sp. Methanol extractions of five plant species were done by cold immersion extraction method. The larvicidal activities were assessed in the laboratory by carried out a bioassays following WHO guideline with the dose concentration in the range of&nbsp; 10 to 500 mg/L against late 3rd or early 4th instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The percentage mortality were calculated and lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90) were analyzed subjected to probit analysis. Majority plant extracts showed weak to moderate effect of larvicidal activity. However, among the plant extracts, M. cajuputi exhibited the most effective with highest mortality against Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae compared to other plants. Leaf extracts were shown significantly higher larvicidal effects in relative to stem extracts. The findings also revealed Ae. aegypti is the most susceptible compared to Ae. albopictus. LC50 values of M. cajuputi leaf extracts were 183.35 mg/L and 191.82 mg/L against Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus respectively. This studies suggest leaf extracts of M. cajuputi have moderate potential as larvicidal against vector larvae, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Further studies should be continued to&nbsp; evaluate the effectiveness of&nbsp; M. cajuputi extracts with other various solvents to explore its potential as natural insecticides against other mosquitoes. Isolation and identification of the active chemical compounds in the extracts could be done to\n",

The calculation of this case is not too complicated, however, it can show the differences between quantum world and classical world with clearly. In this letter, we expand the discussion about the infinite square well potential for dynamic potential well&nbsp; by involving relativistic corrections. The dynamic potential is defined as potential wall that depend on time because the potential can moving with constant velocity. The Dirac equation is used to describe condition in the potential well. By this consideration, we hope the result will be useful in the development of nanoelectronic devices. To obtain solution of probability density of Dirac particles that depend on space and time, we transform the Dirac equation into hyperbolic coordinates and the differential equations can be solved by separation variables method.

Vegetation regulates the hydrological cycle making water faces all the stages adequately causing the process stability. Vegetation retains great parcel of the rainwater, freeing it for the water courses and surface and subterranean reservoirs, little by little. In this work, the impact of deforestation over the hydric regimen of the City of Petrópolis was analyzed. The results show that the reduction of vegetation coverage provoked annual outflows increases. The reduction of the vegetation coverage from 58% to 39% caused addictions in average outflow of 60%. This brought the increase of the draining index from 0.29 to 0.50. Changes are also verified concerning the annual average minimum and maximum outflows. In the first case, there was an increase of 86,3% and, in the second case, the annual average maximum outflow was increased in 49,9%. With the completion of construction of the bridge \\\"Builder João Alves\\\" there was a large real estate appreciation in the Coconut Bar (SE). Construction of the bridge took place between August 2004 and September 2006. The phenomenon of real estate valuation is associated with investments in infrastructure in valorize area, and in particular large investments of public power. In this context, this study could demonstrate that beyond a certain and common census that investments in urban infrastructure value the land, it is possible and necessary to take a fresh look on the issue, you will see not only the work itself and its surroundings, but trying to understand that bridge works have the particularity to \\\"nudge\\\" people, interests, investments, integrate neighborhoods, integrating cities; and that this whole set of associated things are able to move an entire polo valorize; and thus, polo valorize would not just something that once implanted becomes fixed, but something that can be dynamic, something that already exists but difficult access. By developing hypotheses and graph analysis of comments on the land value in the Coconut Bar municipality (SE) in a pre, during and post-construction bridge Aracaju (SE) the Coconut Bar (SE), can if evidence that the construction of the bridge valued the land at the Coconut Bar (SE), but the main aspect of recovery did not occur for the implementation of the bridge itself as infrastructure, but by the displacement of \\\"area valorize Aracaju (SE)\\\" , which went from influence highly influence that city. This work presents a comparative study between two biomasses, eucalyptus and elephant grass (known also as Miscanthus), evaluating the energy balance of each biomass to meet the energy demand of a standard ceramic industry. In addition, it was analyzed two forms of compaction for elephant grass, baling and briquetting, and briquetting of eucalyptus derived from two conditions of planting, conventional and dense. Also, the study compared two ways of drying, solar and induced. The data used for eucalyptus in the analysis were drawn from the relevant bibliographies and, for elephant grass, from a pilot planting in Panorama - SP, with analyses in laboratories at IPT - SP. The results show the feasibility, from an energetic point of view, to elephant grass, with a maximum balance ratio of 20.65. While eucalyptus, energy source already consolidated in the market, appears with a maximum ratio of 11.35. It was concluded that elephant grass has an optimistic outlook as an energy source, excelling above eucalyptus. This paper describes some of the uses of remote sensing in environmental forensics in Public Ministry of Piauí. The study of the environment has a lot to earn with the use of remote data obtained primarily by satellite sensors. In order to make a good investigation analysis it is necessary accuracy and reliability on the sources. Also, in many cases, the data should have known date. The Public Ministry is the governmental institution responsible for defending the collectives and social wrights. Nowadays, the main challenge of the institution is respond the raising social needs in the society. The main goal of this work paper is demonstrate how its duty has been improved by the use of georefereces information and images from satellites. The examples of exams presented here showed that the use of geoprocessing tools allied to remote sensing data have been successfully used on environmental forensics. Based in the field of Mechanical Engineering with emphasis on vehicular dynamics, this research aims at the computational design and modeling of the brake system for a high-performance formula single-seater vehicle, meeting all the standards required by SAE International. A brake operates thanks to the friction resulting from the contact between a non-rotating member of the vehicle and a disc or drum that rotates with the wheel. The friction produces the necessary force to reduce the speed of the automobile by converting to heat that the mechanical energy of the vehicle dissipates in the air. (COSTA, 2002). The brakes system is an essential component of the vehicle, an indispensable but little remembered item of safety, only in those crucial moments for which no one would like to pass. Its incorrect sizing will result in not very pleasant results, it is a system that does not allow failures. The work developed qualifies as the nature, as of applied research type and as motivation, the need to produce knowledge to apply its results, with the purpose of building for practical purposes (Barros and Lehfelden, 1989). Materials related to vehicle dynamics were analyzed and it was possible to develop a very practical tool for brake designers, a single - vehicle brake system sizer. For its operation it is necessary that the designer provides the initial design data (vehicle weight, height, width ...) that the program performs the calculations and returns with the scaled system. The research is based on the concepts of vehicular dynamics (GILLESPIE, 1992) and brake design (LIMPERT, 1999). This research is justified by the lack of work related to the dimensioning of brakes for single-user vehicles nationwide. All the study developed can be used in the dimensioning of brake system for other types of vehicles, of greater or smaller size. Neuroscience has been progressively evolving in recent decades, especially in the field of organ and system physiology. In an attempt to integrate the animal brain into a machine, researchers have mobilized to promote the recovery of patients with lost or compromised motor faculties, such as mobility and sensitivity, due to genetic factors, accidents or even paralysis. This has been done through the use of neuroprostheses, which act to provide a more dignified and comfortable life for its users. The present study aims to review the literature pertinent to the theme, pointing out the benefits and new possibilities brought about by the implementation of robotics in the treatment of patients with serious locomotor limitations. In order to reach this end, a bibliographical research was carried out, where the contributions of several authors related to the theme were described, with an overview of the concepts of artifacts such as prostheses, exoskeletons and robotic orthoses, with the purpose of discussing their applications, As well as the way in which such artifacts can aid in the rehabilitation of patients. The bidding rounds of the National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) have been taking place in Brazil since the fall of Petrobras\\' monopoly, through Law 9478 1997. Since then, the ANP and the National Council of Energy Research (CNPE) was created with the aim, among others, to promote free competition, attract investment in energy production and increase the country\\'s competitiveness in the international market. From this, many companies were created and other foreign became part of the hall of investors and explorers throughout the country. Sometimes the understanding of the bidding process is incipient by many technical professionals in the E&amp;P industry, leaving part of decisions and involvement of this process for managers who, in turn, can ignore fundamental technical aspects at the time of bid to obtain the blocks. We aimed to, through this work, describe succinctly and objectively the bidding judgment variables: Signature Bonus (BA) Minimum Exploratory Program (PEM) and Local Content (CL) – and, most of all, how the technician can influence this process before the bidding round. The agents of radiopaque are compounds introduced in the bodies through different ways, which allow to enhance radiographic imaging definitions, enabling to obtain higher imaging definition exams. This study has the objective to describe the adverse iodinated effects on the use of MRI. Thus, a bibliographic review is shown giving emphasis on the presentation of the iodinated contrast and on the adverse response developing a descriptive-exploratory research with qualitative analysis, according to research online. The results found show that, most of the times, a patient who makes use of iodinated contrast, may have a good response, showing no problems and when the reactions appear, they tend to be light and easily controllable by the doctors. The most frequent evidences in studies are the vasovagal reactions, in general, not serious, like nausea, vomiting and pallor. The pseudo-allergic reactions may cause skin itch or evolve with the appearance of nettle rash, angioedema, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, bronchospasm, Laryngeal edema, blood pressure decrease and syncope. Based on this, the administration of iodinated contrast agent and the patient’s well-being on the use of MRI are important, mainly because of what refers to the diagnostic center doctor team’s having the criteria to prevent these reactions to contrasts and being attentive to the risk factors presented, trying to minimize the adverse reactions occurrence. Concrete is a building material that has its widespread use worldwide. Some factors, such as the choice of inappropriate materials and handling, as well as exposure to aggressive environments, can lead to pathologies in this material. Deterioration, for example, can occur in the inner part of the material, such as the alkali-aggregate (RAA) reaction, where the alkalis in the cement paste interact with the reactive minerals in the aggregate. This type of reaction can result in an expansive gel, where it can cause generalized fissures and thus compromise the quality of the structure when it is placed in the voids of the concrete and the surface of the aggregate in contact with the cement paste. The RAA can be of three types: alkali-silica reaction; alkali silicate reaction; and alkali-carbonate reaction. Each type of reaction depends on the reactive mineralogical composition of the aggregate. Faced with the problems generated by the RAA, several studies have looked for ways to minimize these effects. One of the methods most used to reduce the impacts caused by RAA is the use of mineral additions. In this way, this work aimed to search the state of the art on the effects of the main mineral additions used to mitigate the RAA. It was evidenced from the results that the addition of pozzolanic materials in concretes and mortars to mitigate RAA can be quite effective. It was observed that the most used additions are rice husk ash, fly ash, granulated blast furnace slag, steel slag, active silica and metakaolin. Some results have made it possible to conclude that these additions help to reduce the expansions in the AAR, but if they do not have an optimal content, they can act in the opposite way, facilitating the reactions. Inadequate disposal of tires in nature causes harmful effects on the environment worldwide due to the risk of contamination to air, soil and groundwater. Thus, in order to recycle the use of this material, the research employs partial bulk substitutions of the fine aggregate (15% and 25%) by sifted rubber residue passing through the 1.2mm sieves and retained in the 0.6mm production of coating mortars. The objective is to evaluate the possibility of the viable use of this mortar and for this it carries out the tests of resistance to compression, absorption by capillarity and evaluation of the thermal performance. In the experimental study, the 1:3 trait was defined and material characterization and mortar performance evaluation tests were performed, according to the methodology and in accordance with the specific standards.

The pedagogical aspect has a significant influence on the content development and learning, with the attention to the technique and interaction behavior between the lecturer and the students. In other hand, the technological aspect affects the dynamic content development and rich multimedia, and provides the features of hybrid-learning system components. Synergizing both aspects should improve the quality of content development, supported by the hybrid learning process in order to achieve the optimal learning process. The subjective analysis of the synergizing in hybrid learning shows that the online learning can represent the conventional learning environment.The potential advantage of this research is to transform the role of the lecturers and students in learning. The role of the lecturers has been changed from: (1) the knowledge transmitter, source of information, the content master, and the source of all answers, to be the learning facilitator, coach, collaborator, knowledge navigator, and learning partner; (2) the controller and director of all learning aspects to be the person who gives more opportunities and responsibility to the students in every learning process. In this way, the role of the students in learning has been changed from: (1) the passive receiver of information to be the active participant in learning process; (2) reciting knowledge into producing knowledge, (3) the solitaire individual activities into the collaborative activities.The results of the activities are: (1) compilation of a hybrid learning model for the students at Business Management Department, Indonesia University of Education, based on the learning model and students behavior. The content of hybrid learning course is the synergy between pedagogical and technological aspects that enables the individualization, acceleration, enrichment, extension, effectiveness and productivity of learning, that can in turn improve the quality of learning as an infrastructure of human resources development as a whole. Through the hybrid learning model, each student will be motivated to actively learn in accordance with their potent and skills.

This article analyzes about television as medium to do hegemony which is executed by President Alma Coin, one of authorizers in “Mockingjay” novel which is the focus of the performer of hegemony in this article. Coin is the authorizer of District 13—outcast region of a state named Panem. She wants to overthrow President Coriolanus Snow from his position as the authorizer of Panem. To do her hegemony, Coin ignites uprising movement by using Katniss Everdeen as Mockingjay—face of the uprising—and make Propos—propaganda spots—which is broadcasted to all over Panem through television. Katniss is used by Coin as puppet to deliver her government speeches because Katniss has huge influence in Panem. Coin also makes Propos which contains footage videos of Snow’s cruel authorization which will doctrine Panem subjects and lead them into their belief alteration to Coin as a purpose. This article uses qualitative descriptive method to analyze television which is used as medium of authorizer’s hegemony in “Mockingjay” novel. The result of this article shows that television certainly can be a medium of authorizer, in this case is Coin, to do hegemony. Coin makes Propos and broadcasts it in television which aims to impose her political opponent, Snow, and to earned the whole Panem subjects’ voice. In addition, Coin also uses Katniss as the main star of her Propos because of the influence that Katniss has. The research entitled “Indirect Speech Acts of Questioning in Gone Girl Movie Script: A Study of Pragmatics” analyses kinds of speech acts that is used to convey question. However, this research only focuses on indirect speech acts that speaker used to convey their question. In the research, the writer uses the theory of Speech acts and speech event in Pragmatics and The Study of Language written by George Yule (1996, 2010). Yule reveals that based on the relationship between grammatical structure and the communicative function, sentence can be direct and indirect. Moreover, it also influences by context where the conversation takes place. The research uses descriptive method. The writer collected the data found in Gone Girl movie script and then analyzed the sentences that has a function to make question. After doing the analyses, it can be concluded that to convey their questions, people do not only use interrogative sentence, but also declarative sentence. This is called as indirect speech acts. Indirect speech acts happens when there is an indirect relationship between grammatical structure and its communicative function. This research entitled “Verb Ellipsis in Charles Dickens’s Novel: Bleak House” discusses about the existence of verb ellipsis in the clause of the novel. The research uses theory from Nunan in his book entitled “Introducing Discourse Analysis” (1993). This research also uses theory from McShane in his book entitled “A Theory of Ellipsis” (2005). In addition, this research uses descriptive method to analyze the data based on the discussion. The data are taken from the novel Bleak House by Charles Dickens because it has many words that are omitted although the reader can still understand. Based on the analysis, the data can be indicated as verba ellipsis. It also includes the type of verba ellipsis, which is gapping. The data can be indicated as gapping because the verb can be omitted in the second part of the clause since it contains the same verb, such as verb position in the first and second clause. In other words, gapping is an ellipsis process that makes unseen verb. Additionally, this research is made to describe the role of verba ellipsis in the clause or in the conversation of the novel. Moreover, it also completes the previous research to discuss ellipsis especially about verb ellipsis. Different language has its own difference in writing or pronunciation Sometimes, an activity may have not&nbsp; the actual word to express it. When one language has no word to express, the word from other’s language is used. The word itself is known as loanword. This case mostly appears in the football area. This article entitled ‘Loan Words in Football Terminology’ explains about the loan word which is usually used in the football terminology. The writer used the dictionary about football terminology “Kamus Istilah Sepakbola” by Nugraha Edy in order to find the data to be analyzed. The writer also uses the theory of Haugen “The ecology of Language” which will describe how the loan word formed. Before analyzing the data, the writer looked for the terminology in the data source and then analyzes it using the theory stated. At the end of analysis, the writer finds that many of football terminology in English has not be converted to Indonesian, so Indonesian has to loan English terminology to express it. The paper entitled “The Interpretation and Applied Strategies of Logo and Tagline of Circle Shoes” discuses: (1) the interpretation of logo and tagline using semiotic approach, and (2) the strategies to create a logo and tagline using the approach of marketing on media. To analyse the data presented, the writer uses descriptive method. In descriptive method, observing, collecting, classifying and analysing data are conducted. \\nThis paper is meant to describe some factors how to create a good identity through logo and tagline besides the meanings of the logo and tagline themselves. \\nBased on the analysis, the results of the research are: (1) the forms of logo give the idea of immortality, completeness, freedom, and protection, besides balance and destination. The black splotches color means a weakness of the product or company; perfection of a product certainly has weakness or deficiency. In addition, tagline shows the simplicity, elegance, uniqueness, timelessness, and memorableness, and (2) getting to know the product and the market target may be an effective strategy to make a logo and tagline that convey essential qualities, brand character, emphasize the benefit of the product, and align brand message with an intended market target. This study argues that every word of any natural language is prone to meaning modification known as pejoration. Pejoration happens when a meaning of words becomes negative and it is different from its original meaning. In order to answer that phenomenon, this study entitled “Pejorative Development of English Word ‘Idiot’: A Study of Etymology” issues that the English word ‘idiot’ may have experienced pejoration. It discusses the history of the word idiot’ and its pejorative development. Liberman and Voyles’s theories are used in this study. In the analysis, Liberman’s theory is applied to explain the history of the word ‘idiot’ and also the development of its meaning, while Voyles’s theory is adapted to see the semantic features of the word ‘idiot’ whether the meaning is specific or general. \\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The descriptive qualitative method is used to explain the phenomena covered in pejorative datum. The datum was analyzed and described using applying grand and supporting theories mentioned earlier.\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result shows that the word ‘idiot’ has&nbsp; experienced degradation of meaning where the word itself in its original meaning meant ‘a private person’, but over time it has acquired a negative connotation. The word is currently used in the sense of ‘a stupid person or someone has done something stupid’ or ‘someone who is mentally ill or has a very low level of intelligence’. This research is regarding narrative in Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows. Narrative has many ways to develop the narrative. One of them is duration. There are five possibilities, which suggest themselves. They are summary, ellipsis, scene, stretch and pause. In each possibility, they have different use of time. Qualitative method and descriptive analysis are used to analyze the data. The data are taken from Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows. The theory used in this research is from Seymour Chatman (1978). Summary occurs when the time is cut short in story-time, complemented with durative verb and adverb. Ellipsis is happened when the discourse in the story is stopped yet the story-time keeps on going, abridging the story-time to the period which is already determined. Scene happens when the story-time and discourse-time run together using dialogue and overt physical actions of relatively short duration. Stretch is happened when discourse-time runs longer than story-time, using imagination to cut short the story-time and enter the discourse time. Pause is occurred when the story-time stops completely and discourse-time takes over, describing the event or characters. Every human being in this world certainly uses a language as communication. In this modern era, there are so many media that provide the means to communicate each other. It’s through social networks such as Facebook or Twitter, or using a cell phone that at this moment there are so many softwares for chatting and SMS. With the Internet in this modern era, the development of language increase rapidly. The created of a new word and language makes the language more variety. Same is in the online games that are widespread recently, that’s easy to find a new words and languages in online games. But not least people do not understand the definition that word. In this research entitled “Neologism using acronyms and abbreviations in DOTA 2” will discusses about the formations of words or meanings using neologism theory in DOTA 2. DOTA 2 is a multiplayer online game that developed by Valve company. There are a lot of new words using the form acronym and abbreviation. This phenomenon is very interesting to discuss in this article because that new language not only used in the game but also used in daily activity by gamer. \\n&nbsp; This research used a novel titled \\\"The Things We Do for Love\\\" by Kristin Hannah. This research discussed the affected of offspring on women existence in a marriage that are reflected by the main character, Angie, in the novel. This research was conducted to know how offspring affects Angie\\'s existence in her marriage. This novel tells the story of a man and a woman named Angie and Conlan, the main character in the novel. Their marriage ended in divorce because as a woman, Angie cannot give the child to her husband. The problem came to Angie when she knew she could not keep her pregnancy a few times, because she had a weak womb which makes Angie loses her existence as a woman, wife and mother. This research method used descriptive method. Where, the data presented related to the topic, and then explain it in detail. Data collected were analyzed using the ideas of Simone de Beauvoir (1949) in his book that addresses the issue Woman Existence and Julie Mitchell (2008) on Woman Revolution. This study argued that violation on maxim of cooperative principle occurs in various type of communication such as in the slogan. This study uses theory from Grice about cooperative principle as main theory and theory about pragmatic context from Cipollone as supporting theory to analyze the data. Based on Grice, violation on maxim of cooperative principle divides into four; violation one maxim, two, three, and four. Cipollone divides pragmatics context into physical context, linguistic, social, and epistemic. In this study, descriptive analysis method is used in analyzing the data. This study is expected can help to understand the strategy of creating slogan that uses violation on maxim of cooperative principle. The result of this study shows that each violation causes other violation\n",
      "99 Ionic liquid had a various uses and among them is as catalyst in a reaction. This research was carried out to synthesis and developed the choline chloride based ionic liquid to investigate their ability as a catalyst in transesterification reaction. The ionic liquid synthesized was choline chloride.2ZnCl2 and choline.2urea based system. Both of the ionic liquid synthesize were characterized by using Infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR &amp; 13C NMR). Characterization result confirmed the functional group and the structure of the ionic liquids was as expected. Both ionic liquid were applied as a catalyst for the transesterification reaction and the resulting product was analyzed by GC-FID and GCxGC-MS (ToF). The transesterification reaction of palm olein and buthanol with the presence of choline chloride.2ZnCl2 gives 25.7% yields while with the use of choline chloride.2urea gives 25.0% yields. The results show that the acidity of choline chloride.2ZnCl2 and the basic properties of the choline chloride.2urea were not really suitable to be used as catalyst in the transesterification reaction. The use of oils and fats for lubrication purposes has been practiced for many years. This is starting that realized since the mineral oil in a limited number. In this research, the production of biolubricant based plant oil is Jatropha Curcas oil and linear alcohol. Oil produced from the fruits is 44.30%. However, oxidative stability and low pour point are problem for biolubricant. The method used to overcome this problem is epoxidation process and ring opening. Epoxidation process successfully carried out by testing the oxyrane value and also FTIR analysis, where the peak of alkenes is 3007 cm-1. Epoxy peak appeared at 843 and 824 cm-1, which is testament to the success of epoxy ring is formed. Ring opening proved successful with FTIR analysis of the appearance of hydroxyl groups at the peak of 3444 cm-1, the peak of ether in 1097 cm-1, and the loss of epoxy peak. Bioubricant which is produced in the form of alcohol ether is to produce five types of biolubricant, which are decanol ether, dodecanol ether, tetradecanol ether, hexadecanol ether and octadecanol ether. 1H dan 13C &nbsp;NMR analysis is also succeeded in proving the presence of key functional groups for the fifth type of biolubricants. In terms of viscosity and flash point, lubricant successful enhanced oil-based plants, but not succeded to reduce the pour point. Thermoplastic natural rubber (TPNR) composites with rice husk (RH) as filler were prepared via melt blending using an internal mixer Brabender Plasticorder. TPNR matrix was prepared from natural rubber (NR) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) with a composition ratio of 60:40. The optimum processing parameters for NR/HDPE matrix was obtained at 135 oC, at mixing rate of 50 rpm and blending time of 12 minutes, while the parameters for the NR/HDPE/RH composite was at 135 oC mixing rate of 45 rpm and blending time of 12 minute. Addition of rice husk into the NR/HDPE matrix was aimed to reinforce the composites with the filler. The high silica content of rice husk has made rice husk to be used as potential reinforcement filler for composites. However, the application of rice husk as filler is limited due to the hydrophilic nature of rice husk surface causing incompatibility and weak interfacial adhesion between rice husk and the hydrophobic polymer matrix. Hence, the cellulose surface of rice husk has to be modified. The rice husk was treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as pre-treatment and later coated with liquid epoxidized natural rubber (LENR). Several concentrations of NaOH solution were used for alkali treatment of untreated rice husk (RHi) and the most effective was at 5% NaOH in aqueous solution (RHiNa). LENR coating was also carried out at several concentrations from 5% to 20% LENR in toluene. Characterizations of rice husk surfaces were analyzed by FTIR, optical microscope and SEM micrograph. The mechanical properties of rice husk filled composites observed, showed that the maximum value obtained were for composites reinforced with alkali treated and coated with 10% of LENR (RHiNaLE 2). The tensile and impact strength obtained were 6.9 MPa and 24.6 kJ/m2 respectively. Effects of RHiNaLE 2 loading on tensile and impact strengths of composites showed that the properties decreased at higher loadings due to agglomeration of filler particles. However the tensile modulus and hardness were found to increase with filler loading. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis also showed that composites prepared exhibited a shift in the tan delta peak (Tg) to a higher temperature due to the increased RHiNaLE 2-Matrix interaction. In conclusion, modification of rice husk surface via NaOH treatment and coating with LENR was successful in reducing the hydrophilic nature of rice husk powder. The RHi-Matrix interfacial adhesion had improved which lead to higher mechanical properties of the composites prepared. This study was conducted to produce a topical delivery system which has an active ingredient which can be used for treatment of skin diseases such as acne and common skin disease.

In recent years, few reports of NP synthesis use mangroves, which are used as bio plants for synthesis. In addition, mangroves are a renewable, sustainable and economical source compared to other marine organisms, so they can be explored effectively in the synthesis of green NPs (Green Synthesis). Therefore, this study reports on the biosynthesis of NP, especially silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using mangrove extracts. NPs synthesized by this method are primarily spherical with promising anti-microbial potential. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles can be triggered by several compounds such as carbonyl, terpenoid, phenolic, tannin, flavonone, amine, amide, protein, pigment, alkaloid and other reducing agents in biological extracts capable of as reducing agents and capping agents. Marine bio-nanotechnology has great promise in nanomedicines, groceries, pharmaceuticals and industrial fabrics for the future.

Purpose: The study sought to investigate the effect of financial innovations on financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. The main problem was that there is an increase in the number of financial innovations, but whether the innovations in banking industry are the main determinants of financial performance is a hard to tell. Despite the significance of financial innovation, the effect of innovation on financial performance is still misunderstood.Methodology: The study adopted an explanatory research design. The population of the study was all the 43 commercial banks operating in Kenya in the study period. The study conducted a census on all the 43 commercial banks. The study used primary data. An ordinary linear regression model was used. The regressions were conducted using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 20.Results: The study findings indicated that there is a negative and significant relationship between product innovation and ROA. The relationship between service innovation and ROA and also organizational innovation and ROA was found to be positive and significant. Based on the findings, the study concluded that commercial banks in Kenya in the study period had unsteady trends in ROA despite the fact that more financial innovations were taking place in the sector. The study also concluded that the relationship between product innovation and financial performance of commercial banks is negative and significant. Based on the study findings, the study also concluded that the relationship between service innovation and ROA and also organizational innovation and ROA is positive and significant.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that Commercial banks should implement effective product innovation strategies that won’t increase their operational risks which in turn affects their financial performance. The study also recommended that commercial banks should focus more and invest more in both service and organization innovation as the two will lead to better financial performance. Purpose: The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between interest rates and gearing ratios of firms listed in the Nairobi Securities Exchange.Methodology: The study was carried out using a longitudinal research design, employing secondary quantitative data. The population for this study constituted of all listed companies in the Nairobi Securities Exchange. As at December 2013, there are 62 companies listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. This study did not sample and hence a census survey was carried out for the study. The study used secondary data. All the data was collected by review of documents, annual reports of the companies, the Nairobi Securities Exchange Handbooks and published books of accounts. The selected period was year 2009 to year 2013 (5 years).The researcher used frequencies, averages and percentages in this study. The researcher used Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to generate the descriptive statistics and also to generate inferential results. Regression analysis was used to demonstrate effect of interest rate on the gearing ratio of listed firms.Results: These results showed that there is a negative relationship between gearing ratio and interest expense and profitability as supported by beta coefficients of -0.486 and -0.129 respectively. Firm size had a positive correlation (0.275), which means that an increase in firm size causes an increase in the gearing ratio. The analysis also yields results that showed that interest expense, firm size and profitability were statistically significant.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: the study recommended that; the firms should adopt strategies that increase their firm size resulting to a scenario whereby they increase their collateral and thus granting them the ability to access more debt, firms should ensure that they optimize their profits so as to reduce their gearing ratio and thus cause growth, firms should seek to adopt other ways of financing their activities since interest expense had a negative relationship with gearing ratio. Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to establish the effect of voluntary financial disclosures on the stock returns of companies listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange.Methodology: The main purpose of this study is to establish the effect of voluntary financial disclosures on the stock returns of companies listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange. This study used a descriptive study design. The population of the study was all the 61 firms listed at the NSE as at December 2013. The sampling technique was purposive or judgmental, as the study purposively chose the 20 companies consistently making up the NSE –20 share index between 2009 and 2013 (five years) because they are rich in information and are blue chip. The study used secondary data from the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). The selected period was year 2009 to year 2013 (5 years).The particular secondary data was extracted from financial statements of sample firms and from the Nairobi Securities Exchange handbook for the five years period of study, from 2009 to 2013.The researcher used frequencies, averages and percentages in this study. The researcher used Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 to generate the descriptive statistics, trend analysis and also to generate inferential results. A multivariate regression model was used to link the independent variables to the dependent.Results: The study findings indicated that corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, environment accounting, human resource accounting, financial services sector, divided pay out and firm size had a positive relationship with stock returns.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that firms should embrace voluntary financial disclosure as it posits them to many privileges/advantage. These advantages may include; easy access to external financing, securing a good name with governmental and non-governmental organizations, having a good public image. In addition, the study recommends that firms should ensure a balance of their debt to equity as increased debt is seen to cause a reduction on the stock returns. Purpose:The purpose of the study was toassess the effects of Basel III framework on capital adequacy requirement in commercial banks in Kenya. The study sought to address the following research questions: why are capital adequacy regulations important in commercial banks in Kenya? What challenges are commercial banks facing in the implementation of capital adequacy requirement? What measures have commercial banks taken to ensure compliance with the capital adequacy requirement?Methodology:A descriptive survey design was applied to a population of 43 commercial banks operating in Kenya. The target population composed of the 159 management staff currently employed at the head offices of the various commercial banks in Kenya. The population was composed of Senior, Middle and Junior or Entry level Management staff. A sample of 30% was selected from within each group.Primary data was gathered using questionnaires which were dropped off at the bank’s head offices and picked up later when the respondents had filled the questionnaires. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze quantitative data while content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data.Results:The findings show that capital adequacy requirement is important in commercial banks because it leads financial stability in the Kenyan economy, improves credit risk management techniques as poor credit risk management requires more capital and leads to reduced vulnerability to liquidity shocks due to the sound capitalization policies being implemented under the Basel III framework. Findings also revealed that capital adequacy affected the balance sheet structure of the commercial banks in Kenya.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that banks should continue the pursuit of various strategies to ensure that they are in compliance with Basel III requirements and the Central Bank of Kenya’s Prudential Guidelines. The staff of this committee should be drawn from mainly the finance, legal, compliance and treasury departments. Compliance with the capital requirements will lead to a safety net for all commercial banks as the additional capital will act as a cushion that absorbs losses in case of distress in the commercial banking sector.

The Bayt al Hikmah (House of Wisdom) was a major intellectual center during the Islamic Golden Age. The House of Wisdom was founded by Caliph Harun al-Rashid and culminated under his son al-Ma\\'mun who is credited with its formal institution. Al-Ma\\'mun is also credited with bringing many well-known scholars to share information, ideas and culture in the House of Wisdom. Based in Baghdad from the 9th to 13th centuries, many learned scholars including those of Persian or Christian background were part of this research and educational institute. Besides translating books into Arabic and preserving them, scholars associated with the House of Wisdom also made many remarkable original contributions to diverse fi elds. During the reign of al-Ma\\'mun, astronomical observatories were set up, and the House was an unrivaled center for the study of humanities and for science in medieval Islam, including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, alchemy and chemistry, zoology and geography and cartography. Drawing on Indian, Greek, and Persian texts, the scholars accumulated a great collection of world knowledge, and built on it through their own discoveries. By the middle of the ninth century, the House of Wisdom was the largest repository of books in the world. Abstract The library is a place to find information, interact and look for ideas. The library of the Department of Mining Engineering UPN \\\"Veteran\\\" Yogyakarta is one of the libraries that provides services for students in the learning process.

Library service becomes the benchmark of the library success. Library service is said to be good if the utilization of service is done maximally. It is related to user education, which in this case the purpose of user education is to provide education about the library so that users can utilize library services effectivelly and efficiently. This study aims to describe the role of the user education towards the utilization behavior of library service of the students of Faculty of Communication Sciences Padjadjaran University. The method used in this research is survey with quantitative descriptive approach. The sample of this research consists of 93 students of class of 2016 were chosen by accidental sampling technique. The results of this study show that the role of knowledge about layout, facilities, policy, and library services towards the utilization behavior of library service in the medium category. Meanwhile, the role of knowledge about librarians and the staffs in the library and library collections towards the utilization behavior of library service in the high category. So, it shows that the knowledge about library can encourage students to take advantage of library services because having knowledge about library will facilitate the user in utilizing library services. Library accreditation is a procedure in order to evaluate all the activities of the organization of the library is measured based on the parameters specified quality standards. The standard is the benchmark measure of quality. Managing the college library-based accreditation means applying the concept of accreditation in the management of the library. There are nine components that need to be referenced accreditation based library management services, collaboration, collection, organizing library materials, human resources, building / space and infrastructure, budget, library management and collections care. Ninth aspect of this being used as a reference library management roadmap in order to realize the quality of the library. Islamic studies presents severe challenges even to an experienced specialist. Many of these are technical in nature; multitude of languages needed to read both sources and modern scholarship, the vast number of major texs still in manuscript, the poor of libraries and archives. But more important is the diffi culty of grasping the subject as a whole,of developing a clear sense of broad themes and concepts through which this sprawling and underdeveloped fi eld of study can be bound together. This written is to propose some of the lines of inquiry and research strategies which might be used to construct a persuasive and well-integrated synthesis of the Islamic past. The need for information can happen to anyone, anytime, and anywhere. Therefore, the information needs will be very possible for students with disabilities.This study aims to see how the needs and behavior of students with disabilities in information search. The method that used in this research is qualitative method by observation and interview as data acquisition technique. Informants in this study are students with disabilities in UIN Sunan Kalijaga Yogyakarta, which are 2 people. The results of the research will be used as a basis, especially for library managers in the provision of library materials. Based on the above analisys results, it can be concluded that basically students with disabilities have the same needs and behavior with other students. Researchers identify the information required by students with disabilities, are: 1) lifestyle, 2) lectures, 3) general, 4) social life, 5) health and 6) future plans. While in the search for information, they tend to meet the information needs using the internet. The development of technology and information brings a number of indispensable consequences, and it requires a wiser adaptation to apply them in the library to avoid the entailed negative impacts. This article discusses the idea of applying information technology of library in hand for library services. It is based on observations of the benchmarking activities in several countries and review on various literatures. Presentation and analysis are conducted descriptively, with the conclusion that the library should be about to adaptively follow the development of IT by considering the contextual social effects. In this context, the application of library in hand includes SMS gateway, Interactive Learning, Independent Learning, Online Reservation, and Online Library Information Retrieval. Meanwhile, the social effects that arise from this application are seen from three dimensions namely the structural, cultural and interactional ones.\n",
      "102 It is noticeable the public debate has been tough over the past few years in Brazil, as a result of the rising of several topics and issues highly relevant to national life. Such discussions have involved all Brazilian society, including members of the Public Prossecutor’s Office, all externalizing opinions, ideas and critics, which doesn’t ceases to be beneficial to the enhancement of democracy. As it is known, free manifestation of thought is a fundamental right conferred to Brazilians and foreign residents of the country, recognized by the Federal Constitution especially on its 5th article, clause IV. Due to this growing involvement of members of the Public Prossecutor’s Office in these discussions, by the most varied media, including the internet, by the called social media, of powerful range, what also emerges as point of debate the various nuances of freedom of speech, noticeably from the member of the Public Prossecutor’s Office. This article proposes to discourse about this question, considering the ministerial obligation of protecting remote constitutional rights, of equal importance, as intimacy, private life’s secrecy, honor and people’s image. The focus of this article is to study about the inconstutitional aspects of the Inquiry n° 4.781/DF, stablished by the Minister Dias Toffoli of the Supreme Federal Court. Using the inductive method, the paper begins with contextualizing the origin of the fundamental rights and its characteristcs, specially of the right to freedom of expression. Subsequently, the origins of the Public Prossecution are analysed, as well as its constitutional attributions described in the article n° 127 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil of 1988. Finally, the facts that imput the opening of the Inquiry n° 4.781/DF are brought, and are pointed out its inconstitutional aspects due to the attribution assigned to the Public Prossecution in the Constitution. Stormy subject concerns the limits of freedom of expression related to the member of the Public Prosecution. The Federal Constitution establishes to the member of the institution the defense of the legal regime, the democratic order and the indispensable social and individual rights, arming its officials with functional independence, so that it may not be subjected to internal or external pressures in the practice of its activities. The Constitution demanded that the members of the Public Prosecution played a leading role in the evolution of Brazilian society, and that they come to participate of the social transformation expected by the constituent process. On the other hand, it expressly prevented such agents from engaging in political party activities. This paper aims to analyze the possibilities of the member of the Public Prosecution to express their positions and political opinions, without incurring in the constitutional prohibition of political party activities engagement. The Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, promulgated on October 5, 1988, when establishing the institutional functions of the Public Prosecutor’s Attorney Office in articles 127 and 129 establishes the duty / right of social communication as ombdusman of society. The correct interlocution with the society goes through the direct and effective approach with all the channels of communication of its own. Resolution no. 58, dated July 5, 2017 establishes guidelines on how the Brazilian Public Prosecution Service must act in an interdependent manner and with an adequate strategy to manage its relationship with the press, without prejudice to the fundamental right to freedom of expression of its members. Freedom of expression is a basic right of the democratic state. The crime of contempt, consubstantiated in the disrespect of a civil servant in the exercise of his function, or because of it, limits freedom of expression. The ratification of the American Convention on Human Rights by Brazil in 1992 imposed on the country the need for its internalization, in addition to observing the precedents established by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The national control of conventionality must be carried out to avoid divergences between national norms and the Inter-American Human Rights System. This article aims to analyze the freedom of expression limits of the Public Prosecution Service members in the Brazilian and international law. First, we will explore the content and limits of this fundamental right, which holds a preferred position in the country constitutional system. Then, a critical exam of the prosecutor’s functional duties is made, as well as of the foundations and institutional objectives of the Public Prosecution Service. Finally, based on the jurisprudence of the National Council of the Public Prosecution Service, the article presents parameters for the manifestation of these agents, especially for the purpose of applying disciplinary sanctions. Discusses in this article the subject of rape of vulnerable, which is the legal successor called rape presumed violence, specifically at the point of vulnerability is the age of the victim, under 14 years, as changes introduced by Law 12.015/2009, seeking the establishment of landmarks hermeneutical departing from constitutional principle of priority of childhood and youth, collective protection for the prevention of child abuse and sexual violence. Defends the need for a vision in the light of the doctrine of the effectiveness of constitutional norms, with the wish for transformation of the still strongly The aim of this work is presenting some initiatives of CNMP related to the regulation of the Ministry Public’s transparency portals, highlighting its historical and normative evolution. It contextualizes the role of the Public Ministry in this scenario as a defender of democracy. Finally, we discuss some initial practical of knowledge management which has been implemented in the Public Ministry in Brazil. Why anti-corruption policies fail so often? Most anti-corruption easures that have been tried in recent years are inspired by an understanding of corruption as a problem of agency. They assume that the principal is always interested in improving its control over the agent. But this does not usually happen in social settings where the perception of corruption is high. The chapter proposes an alternative way to understand corruption as a collective action dilemma and draws practical lessons for combating it. The approval of the Stare Decisis number 13, from the Supreme Court of Brazil, was important to combat the influence of familiar relationship as a determinant factor to the nomination for public offices in Public Administration, facilitation popularly known as nepotism. Nepotism is facilitation decurrent from familiar relationship, by affinity or consanguinity. In this article, it´s important to reforce that nepotism means the conduction of a person to a public office without a previous selection based on equality, an objective selection and not personal, and based on the qualities of the person that is been nominated, nomination this that it wouldn´t occur if the familiar relationship isn´t on. After some years, new manifestations from nepotism can come, and others still survive. One of the objectives of this study is to take from the obscure scene the invisible faces. The facilitation may be attacked. One of the invisible faces of nepotism is the late nepotism or posthumous nepotism – develop in this article –, when the anterior administrative officers use the influence that they still have in the public agency of the Public Administration to nominate people from their families, and they don´t use the public office, because they´re already out of it, but the anterior administrative officers use their influence that already exists. Preventive actions of Public Prosecutor´s Office as a mediator and social negotiator towards Good Administration culture brings beneficial effects in combating administrative misconduct in Brazil. Good Administration is a fundamental right and also a standard principle. The Good Governance idea is originally from Anglo-Saxon law and contributes to the Good Administration concept. The Brazilian Public Prosecutor´s Office, as people´s Ombudsman, must direct its activities in search of the implementation of the fundamental right to Good Administration by means of a preventive and educational action and not only repressive approach.\n",
      "103 In the context of dynamic changes in technologies and economics, the question of the development of themodern form of organization of the economic space - the platform economy - has been mainstreamed. The purpose of thearticle is to determine the theoretical basis for the formation of the platform\\'s economy as the latest form of organizationof the regional space. Subjective methods of the research-comparative analysis, systemology, structural-logical, analogymethod. The result of the research is the author\\'s definition of the platform economy of the region. It is a form oforganization of the economic space based on the network-based way of interaction and interaction of the consumer,producer and provider of relations in the form of a business platform, interests, relations, communications on the basisof consensus priorities and environmental equilibrium within the regional space and time.A comparative analysis of themain properties of the economic cluster and platform was carried out. The contours of changes taking place on the basisof the platform approach in business, politics and social interaction in the region and cities are determined. Thetransformation of the target definitions of regional authorities in the formation of a new system of economic and socialcoordinates is outlined. The new roles of regional authorities in the digital economy system are defined: a) a catalyst forsocial processes in the region that supports civic activity and social activity; b) an arbiter in balancing the economicinterests of the platform\\'s participants; c) organizing a dialogue between different platform participants for producing amore favorable development strategy space for life, d) integrator of creation of new digital products, programs, projectsof social and economic development of the region on the territory of the region. An existing theoretical approaches to the noospheric paradigm of socio-economic development in globalizationconditions were considered in the article. The purpose of the article is determination of the noospheric paradigm ofdevelopment of transport-logistic clusters as base reality of human evolution, which is intended to achievement of thesocial goods and provision of humanity progress. Direction of economic development of transport-logistic clusters bytaking into account planetary influence and interests of separate regional associations were distinguished. The mainfactors of forming of transport-logistic clusters were outlined. The expediency of taking into account of worldaccumulations of knowledge and national innovative systems which are promoting the formation of cluster associationsin the form of transport-logistic clusters as a significant factor of providing of competitiveness of Ukraine wasunderlined. It is determined that in the transport-logistic system of cluster type a financial capital is examined as afinancial service of material stream along with informative and service services. The graphic model of components ofthe noospheric paradigm of development of transport-logistic clusters in the conditions of globalization is offered. Atransport-logistic cluster as a voluntary association includes are transport enterprises, logistic mediators,representatives of organs of local-authority, research institutes, institutes of civil society. For the effective functioningof transport-logistic cluster needed: modern rolling stock, highly skilled labour resources, legislative base,coordinating-logistic center. The main systemically important an attribute, orientated on the stable progress in thefuture and based on the imperative of an intelligent human behavior, is an increase of socioeconomic, ecologicaleffectiveness of transportations of goods and passengers. The general intent of all participants, which united in acluster, is welfare of people, preservation of the environment for future generations.Keywords: paradigm, noosphere economy, transport-logistic clusters, competition, cooperation The article deals with the problems of formation and development of investment attractiveness of modern forms oforganization of the region\\'s economy. The relevance of the article is determined by the need to manage the investmentattractiveness of the region: to form, develop, change, modify, store, use, reduce, etc.The author’s position is based on the modern approach to organization of the region’s economy which considersinvestments as the basis of economic activity of the state, region, city or individual enterprise, provides for thetransition to long-term system management of investment activity and which is based on client orientation andpartnership, clear definition of target audiences and their needs, the formation of a flexible regional investment policy,the use of both traditional and non-traditional instruments of enhancement, conservation, and, occasionally, reductionof the investment attractiveness of the region.Approaches to the definition of the category \\\"investment attractiveness of the region\\\" are considered, our owndefinition is proposed which is formed on the basis of a marketing approach, which becomes a priority in thedevelopment of modern forms of organization of the region’s economy. According to the marketing approach, theinvestment attractiveness of the region is expressed by the level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries’ expectations ofinvestment activity from the universal (objective and subjective) conditions (features, preferences, representations,possibilities and constraints) for attracting investments and transforming them into projects, productions, products andservices, formed within the framework of a certain form of organization of the region’s economy.The successful practice and experience of Ireland and France in implementing the policy of investmentattractiveness of the regions’ economy are considered. It is established that the modern approach to the policy ofinvestment attractiveness of the region\\'s economy involves multimodal regional development, a variety of options forinteraction and partner models, selection of effective technologies, methods and tools for its implementation.Directions, means and tools of regional management and marketing are defined, which is advisable to apply in theprocess of formation of investment attractiveness of modern forms of organization of the region’s economy.Keywords: investment attractiveness, region’s economy, forms of organization, marketing approach, regionalmarketing, regional management. In that work has been shown that the decentralization of power is an effective instrument of economic developmentthrough the efforts of the independence of local self-government and increase its activity, strengthening of democracyon the ground. The structure and properties of the regional economy and the specificity of the creative approach to theformation of modern areas of development in Ukraine on the basis of the launch of regional studies have been&nbsp;substantially studied. It is shown that the concept of a knowledge economy is the basis for the involvement of regionalstudios in the economic practice of preserving and developing the modern regions of Ukraine and their mentality. Thedevelopment of the territories and the real sector of the region\\'s economy is presented as a systemic process ofqualitative change, which involves the ability to create an effective management system and innovative approach to thedevelopment of the modern region. It is proved that the region as a managed and control system is directly related tothe administrative-territorial division of Ukraine.It is noted that modern regional development and the implementation of the decentralization process provide forthe availability of mechanisms that will achieve effective interaction of all levels of government and ensure its balance.This is the denationalization of property, the consolidation by the territorial communities of the relevant communalproperty with the guarantee of its full use, the formation of regional and local budgets, the system of optimal taxationand intergovernmental relations, and the organization of effective control over the activities of public authorities.Analytical studies have shown that the administrative-territorial reform requires an active scientific search formodern mechanisms for the effective functioning of the regions of Ukraine. A special condition of this process is thepreservation of the mental (in the broad sense) of the specificity and identity of a certain territory, since regions arepredominantly formed on the basis of economic feasibility, combining territories with similar economic structures thatmay not coincide with the cultural or ethnic specificity of a particular territory; accordingly, a certain linguistic, ethnicor cultural group can be divided between several regions, or vice versa - within a single region there may be severalgroups with different cultural characteristics. Proceeding from such positions, it is suggested to introduce in thescientific practice the definition of \\\"regional studios\\\", which provides for a certain creativity of actions in an organiccombination with constant training and improvement. It is determined that regional studios are a complex category, aterm that corresponds to the study and monitoring of processes taking place in the region: historical, cultural, culturaland ethical, socio-economic, political, economic-geographical, ecological and natural sciences, etc. In the generalsense, such an approach is associated with the work of a broad-based analyst, which envisages, among other things,work on developing strategies for socio-economic development, forecasting regional budgets, marketing of territories,etc. It is logical to take into account in this area the activities of professional lobbyists of different levels. An importantcomponent of research in the direction of the development of regional economic studies is the formation of mechanismsfor improving the competitiveness of regions in the international, social, environmental, economic, etc. spheres.&nbsp;\\nKeywords: regional studies, regionalism, decentralization, administrative-territorial reform, regional development The purpose of the article is to diagnose regional features of the spread of continuing education in Ukraine. Theexpediency and necessity of extending continuous education to the country\\'s economy is substantiated. The compositionof the principles of continuing education is supplemented, the implementation of which should contribute to the formationof a knowledge economy in the region and the country. The principles were divided into three groups, the first wassupplemented by the principle of accessibility, the second – complexity, the third – competitiveness and socio-economicreturn. A retrospective analysis of the regional distribution of the main instrument of continuous education in Ukraine isheld in Ukraine – the improvement of the qualification of the personnel of enterprises. The analysis was carried out forthree years – 2002, 2008 and 2014, which allowed to see the prevailing trends in the country in terms of observance bythe regions of the selected principles. Regions that are leading in the processes of staff development are identified. Theregions were grouped according to the intensity of their professional development in 2008 and 2014. A general decreasein the level of intensity of the processes of professional development has been established. The average periodicity ofqualification improvement in the regional context is analyzed. The main reasons that could lead to the current dynamicsare substantiated. The ways of stabilizing the situation with the upgrading of the qualification of the personnel in theregions of Ukraine are planned, which should increase the degree of compliance with the principles of the spread ofcontinuing education in the country.Keywords: continuous education, principles, regions of Ukraine, advanced training, employees of enterprises, skilllevel The article explains the importance of cross-border cooperation in Ukraine. The aim of the article is to show themain problems of cross-border cooperation. Also there are highlighted the problems of infrastructure development inUkraine. The ways of financing infrastructure objects are offered through the projects of public-private partnership. The purpose of this article is to construct a fuzzy theoretical game model of a competitive market with the use ofoptimization procedures.Marketing activity involves detailed market research. This research requires a simulation of various marketsituations. Therefore, the problem arises to create appropriate mathematical models. To simulate competition in themarket, you can use the theory of games methods. The peculiarity of the market in Ukraine lies in the lack oftransparency in its functioning. This requires the creation of a model with fuzzy conditions.The game model of distribution of the market between different sellers is considered in the article. The search foroptimal strategies for their behavior is proposed through optimization procedures. For this task the game of twoplayers with a zero sum is reduced to the problem of linear programming. It was found that the game problem isequivalent to a pair of dual linear programming problems. For them, the appropriate target functions and restrictionsare defined. It is proposed to solve these problems using the simplex method. In the case of a fuzzy gaming model, it isproposed to consider fuzzy restrictions as a set of alternative constraints for different levels. On the basis of the wholeset of alternatives, form membership functions. They define fuzzy restrictions for the task. In the article for a specificproblem a linear membership function is constructed.The article deals with the case when not all restrictions are fuzzy. For this case, the corresponding membershipfunctions have been formed. They introduce additional parameters. Defining these parameters is proposed by solvingthe corresponding optimization tasks.The article gives an example of the application of the proposed algorithms. Specific initial data for the simulationproblem is defined. Solutions of the corresponding problems of linear programming are calculated. The optimalstrategies of players participating in the game are determined.Competition in the retail market can be described by a fuzzy gaming model. The solution to this model is a set\n",
      "104 This study is to describe the implementation of learning management in subjects that use scientific learning at the IAHN-TP Palangka Raya. This research approach uses a qualitative approach using descriptive design. The research was conducted in Institut Agama Hindu Negeri Tampung Penyang Palangka Raya Indonesia. The researcher collected various information by structured interviews and disguised observations. Analysis of interview data with an interactive model analysis model from Miles and Huberman and analysis of data from observations carried out by the checklist method. The results showed the stages of scientific learning management consisted of stages of learning planning, implementation of learning and supervision of learning. The hoax circulation is very fast because some social media users share without reading or knowing more about whether it\\'s true or not. Increasing literacy can be done well if someone has adequate religious knowledge. The Hinduism have a perspektif the existence of hoax, by understanding it can function as the basis and filter of information to break the chain of hoax circulation. Hoax is made with the aim of making public opinion, herding public opinion, forming perceptions that tests the intelligence and accuracy of internet and social media users. Fake news (hoax) is an act that is not good (asubha karma) so that can be of suffering, therefore in receiving information must maximize wiweka to learn. There are three ways that are used to examine information contained in social media to be able to find out the truth, namely 1). Pratyaksa Pramana; 2). Anumana Pramana; 3). Agama Pramana. The Indonesian people, especially the Hindu community, have their own local wisdom which is an indigenous culture that has been passed down through generations. One of the local wisdoms of the Hindu community is the story found in the lontar text. The teachings of Hinduism are abundant in lontar texts in the form of Babad, Tantri and in the epics of the Mahabharata and Ramayana. In the concept of the story there are many teachings of Hinduism education which can directly be applied in living life in this world. Thus the authors are interested in writing more broadly about the stories in Lontar Swargarohana Parwa contained in the Mahabharata. Lontar Swargarohana Parwa is the last eighteenth part of the Mahabharata. This story is about Yudistira reaching heaven, but he chose to live in hell with his brothers and wife instead of living in heaven with the Korawa and Sekuni, but a few moments later the situation turned to hell and vice versa. In Lontar Swargarohana Parwa there are a lot of Hindu religious education values ​​contained in it, so this paper was carried out to review Lontar Swargarohana Parwa viewed from a study of Hindu religious education. Keywords: Hindu Religious Education, Lontar Swargarohana Parwa &nbsp; &nbsp; In this article, it explains the tolerance that exists in the teachings of Hinduism, in terms of the concept of teachings, texts or memorabilia, and practices and forms of application. Then, related to the concept of teaching tolerance is very much in Hinduism. But, it will be explained a little which includes Tri Hita Karana which defines three balance relations. Then, there is Panca Sradha which means five beliefs in Hinduism. Then, Tat Twam Asih which means a teaching about morality in Hinduism. Then, there is Tri Kaya Parisudha which defines three behaviors that must be sanctified, and others. One of the most well-known questions and guidelines in the life of the nation and state is Bhinneka Tunggal Ika tan hana dharma mangrwa, which if concluded we (all religious people) have many ways to achieve unity. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting interviews and direct observation of Hindu religious figures in East Java, besides that the author also conducts literature studies on various Hindu religious references. This study found that there were a variety of activities carried out by Hindus in the Amertha Juanda Pura Jala siddhi containing tolerance. Usually they do Social Services, Indonesia Celebrates the Difference which is attended by all religious people, again Semalam Nusantara Sidoarjo is an activity that is attended by several different ethnic groups. Mutual respect and mutual appreciation is an attitude that must be possessed by everyone to realize tolerance. Tolerance is the most important aspect of living in a community. Where in living in society, of course, everyone wants a life that is safe, peaceful and peaceful. However, it is undeniable that many differences will be found in society, ranging from the nature, behavior, culture, ethnicity, even different religions of others. Differences can lead us to two opposite things, namely hostility and peace. Differences can be hostile if we cannot respond to differences themselves, and can truly be peaceful if we can accept and respect these differences. Many religious differences cause conflict, but today many religious people are aware of differences and begin to instill tolerance within themselves. As in Confucianism, this ethnic Chinese religion also upholds tolerance. This is done on the grounds that differences do exist and differences are not to destroy each other but to complement. Like the Confucian religion in Indonesia, they appreciate diversity. Chinese ethnicity is aware that Indonesia is a diverse country, and Indonesia was born from these differences. That proves that differences bring unity, not even bring destruction. In Confucianism, it was also taught about tolerance, which was later implicated in community life which was full of diversity. For example, in the Boen Bio temple area in Surabaya, they respect, respect and understand each other with the surrounding community who have different beliefs with them. This study aims to examine the dynamics of traditionality ideology in building holy place among Hindus families in Cakranegara territory, Mataram city. This research was designed in the type of interpretative qualitative research using a case study model. Data collection techniques through observation, interviews, and documentation. Data were analyzed through the stages of classification, reduction, and interpretation. Tri angulation techniques, both tri angulation methods and tri angulation of data sources were used to check the validity of the data. The results showed that the dynamics of traditional ideology in building holy place of Hindu families had been indicated by transformation of cultural traditions at Hinduism practices in four dimensions. First, the position of placing the holy place later no longer applies traditional concepts in a rigid and standard manner. Second, with regard to the spatial size in the construction of holy place in at Hindu families is no longer fixed on the size of the spatial layout that is traditionally applied but adjusted to the situation and condition of karang paumahan (area of home). Third, the form of holy has adapted to the inclusion of external culture. Fourth, the number of pelinggih (holiy place buildings) tends to decrease, especially in the relatively small area of home. Keywords: dynamics, traditionality ideology, holy place, Hindu families. Siwaratri celebration can be said to be a socio-religious construction, this is in view of the externalization element in the form of a Siwaratri concept, objectivation (institutionalization of ritual processes and self-discipline to worship God in its manifestation as a memalina), and internalization, namely the absorption of values ​​and norms in Siwaratri Celebration. as a foundation in realizing the consolidation of hopes, beliefs, awakening mental attitude towards enlightenment and liberation.The construction process is carried out by rearranging information about Siwaratri in the form of knowledge, beliefs, beliefs, values ​​and attitudes, traditions, and patterns of certain actions obtained in this religious practice into a powerful information structure, in a meaningful sense , based on values, integrated and always actively looking to always be reflected back. Knowledge and beliefs about Siwaratri are not objective realities that exist outside of humans, but active reconstruction in the human mind when interacting in religious life and at the same time these beliefs can rebuild certain knowledge, values, and actions that are useful for the subject (Hindus) especially in building personal, structural, and social piety. The Corruption is an act that is prohibited by human law and God\\'s law. The essence of corruption is actions that are contrary to the truth of God\\'s Word, the values ​​contained in corruption are sin or evil. The Methodology of corruption through misdirection, lies, fraud and other evil deeds. The Corruption according to the philosophy of the Christian faith aims to bring people to perish and destruction, The corruption is contrary to God\\'s word and law. The prevention and eradication of corruption can only be done by strengthening the Christian faith, namely applying the law of love in human life. Learning planning is a set of plans and arrangements for learning activities, which contain objectives, materials, learning tools and infrastructure, approaches, strategies or evaluation of results and learning processes used as guidelines in learning on the achievement of learning objectives. Learning planning can provide benefits including facilitating the preparation of learning and facilitating the development of active, creative, effective and enjoyable learning so that it will improve teacher competence. The purpose of this study was to analyze how the implementation of learning planning affects the competence of Hindu religious education teachers. This study uses a qualitative research approach to the type of library research (Library Research). The results of the study show that learning planning is very important for the course of learning because it is a guide for teachers in implementing learning because with good learning planning will implement learning run well that will have an impact on increasing four teacher competencies including pedagogical competence, personality competence, social competence, and professional competence.

Abstract; Harmony becomes important in people\\'s lives, especially in conditions of heterogeneous societies such as Indonesia, living in harmony in the community becomes a mandatory thing that must be in the midst of society. Indonesia, which consists of various tribes, religions and cultures, has tremendous potential for conflict if each individual cannot mature in understanding the reality of diversity. This research uses qualitative research methods, namely researchers conduct observations directly in the field, using various methods in data mining in the field such as interviews, observation, documentation, and data analysis. The object of research in this study is the East Java Inter-Religious Youth Communication Forum (FORKUGAMA), the interfaith youth forum that is interesting to study in the midst of the condition of the community that is being intensely examined with various SARA issues in recent years. In this study there were several findings that researchers found in the field including the strategies carried out by youth in building harmony, there were 4 points namely, strengthening social media networks, building interfaith youth discussion forums, instilling tolerance values ​​early and multiplying moderate narratives in religious. To realize this strategy, the community has important capital in building harmony, namely cultural factors, national factors, the role of religious elites, the role of politicians and the government, but there are also inhibiting factors in building harmony between the factors of political competition, the establishment of synagogues, abuse of religious symbols, deviant religious ideas, economics and public welfare and excessive modernization.\n",

There remained series of civil wars between 1989–1996 and then Tālibān appeared on the scene. The scale of fighting between the Afghāns themselves even increased and so many people joined the majority. Apparently, that bloodshed benefited those who had benefited greatly from war and those who had been receiving dividends. Meanwhile, an entire Afghāns generation had come of age to whom fighting was a highly lucrative profession. Having survived for three years after the end of military assistance and support from the USSR, the Najībullah regime nevertheless ended on April 1992. It seemed that the war had ended as all Mujāhid leaders proclaimed unanimously to establish peace. But the war broke out with new vigour between the Mujāhidīn and the rivals groups. The Mujāhid leadership was totally unable to share power. The country was divided into zones where this or that Mujāhid gourd would manage the affairs. The political and territorial integrity of Afghānistan was virtually shattered. The situation among the militant groups became so horrible that the Afghānis grew utterly hopeless of establishment of peace. There had not occurred as horrible devastation in Afghānistan at the hands of Soviet Forces as it was due to war between Hizb Islāmi and Jamiat Islāmi and their allies.\\nUnder the peace agreement between United State of America and Afghānistan on 29 February, 2020, USA will evacuate Afghānistan in fourteen months. After withdrawal, the US forces the Afghān’s political and Jihād parties need to move ahead politically and democratically learning a lesson from the political crisis created by the Post-Soviet civil war. Being a flexible and moderate religion Islam provides guidelines for the followers in every walk of life. Muslim jurists have been working hard to formulate the principles of Islamic jurisprudence for derivation of Sharī‘ah. The theory of the objectives of Islamic law or “Maqāsid al-Sharī‘ah” holds a significant position in Islamic jurisprudence and gives remarkable principles and rulings when applied for the solution of the issues in life of the followers in economic, social, personal, bioethical or any other area. This research paper intends to discuss the issue of human cloning in the context of Maqāsid al-Sharī‘ah. The Descriptive and analytical research methodologies have been applied for this purpose. The five basic essentials from the classical model of this theory have been illustrated first, then human cloning has been analyzed in their light. For this purpose the two main types of human cloning; Reproductive and Therapeutic have been analyzed considering their distinctive nature and characteristics. In the end reasons have been indicated which prohibit the reproductive type of cloning and suggestions have been forwarded regarding how therapeutic cloning can be treated differently. Maqāsid al-Sharī‘ah reject every biotechnological technique which goes against the basic objectives of Islamic law; protection and preservation of Religion, Life, Progeny, Intellect or property. This reason turns human reproductive cloning prohibited according to the Maqāsid al-Sharī‘ah theory. Islam is a complete code of life. It gives us guidance in every sphere of life either it is private life or public life. In the private sphere of life, Islam gives us even minute and tiniest details for the guidance because a physical human being will never change till the Day of Judgment. But in the public sphere of life, it gives us rules which are to be followed. Islam is a great proponent of freedom of expression. The basic principle of Islam regarding freedom of expression can be derived from the Holy Qur’ān (3:256) “There shall be no compulsion in (acceptance of) the religion. Freedom of expression is a globally accepted phenomenon. The content analysis approach is used in this paper regarding the divine and viable approach regarding freedom of expression. This paper is an attempt to unveil the best possible rules regarding the freedom of expression with certain restrictions that are necessary for a system of checks and balances. Former princely state of Bahawalpur (1727-1947), now one of the administrative divisions of Punjab Province remained the socio-cultural hub. Their rulers assumed the titles of ‘amir’ and ‘nawab’ in due course of the history and proved themselves as capable administrators. At this stage of history one finds their capability of good governance, especially their measures to control the crimes. One can learn a number of positive lessons from this piece of history. In later decades, a number of factors in socio-economic domain affected and altered the crime dynamics in the region, especially in Bahawalpur District which is the main focus of the study in hand. These factors mainly include unemployment, lack of industrial development, landlessness and other rural obligations, ignorance or unawareness about the law of the land, low literacy rate, etc. The Holy Prophet (ﷺ) being the last apostle of Allah is a complete model for human. As there is no concept of difference between the state and religion, so He (ﷺ) at the same time was a religious as well as a political leader. He established a state named Madina, as this new emerged state was facing a lot of problems which were solved by the wisdom of the Holy Prophet (ﷺ). Ruling at Madina. He (ﷺ) set precedents for the better planning, discipline and development of a welfare state.&nbsp; Main focus was on Legislation for the maintenance of discipline, implementation of equal law for all subject, enforcement of Hadood, transformation of authorities to the lower level, establishment of different departments for different responsibilities, superiority of merit and a very strong system of accountability. As now in modern ages state are facing many serious issues regarding discipline and maintenance of peace. There are different type of struggles adopted by different state for discipline and peace but result are not satisfactory. In such circumstances it is the duty of Muslim rulers to adopt the policies and strategy which were adopted by the Holy Prophet (ﷺ) and show the whole universe that the remedies of all ailments regarding discipline and management are lies in the Prophetic teachings which were provided by the creator of this universe. Economics is the study of human behavior which deals with economic activities such as how the human beings earn income and how they spend it on fulfillment of their basic materialistic needs. This behavior is concerned with acquisition, production, exchange and distribution of wealth. The research paper explores the comparative economic behaviors in various ideologies such as secular economic organism; capitalism and communism versus Islamic economic system. Although, secular economic structure has inconsistency in certain aspects like ownership and economic freedom; however, they coincide on materialism and satisfaction of basic economic wants. The unrestricted acquisition of wealth and absolute freedom of consumption created many economic problems; concentration of wealth, inequalities, poverty etc. The Islamic economic system is based on different ideology. The economic behavior in Islamic system is not only important from economic perspective but it also has religious significance. It endorses economic freedom and private ownership but in the profound parameters of Halal and Haram, prohibition of interest, obligation of Zakat and principle of moderation in consumption (against extravagance and stinginess) which lead to social justice, poverty eradication, equitable distribution of wealth and propagation of humanitarianism rather than materialism. Tafsīr-ul-Mīzan is by Shia cleric Allama Muhammad Hussain al-Tabatabai (1903-1981), a moderate thinker associated with the contemporary Shia school of thought.\\nTafsīr has a special significance among Shia and Sunni scholars due to its scholarly demands. And every just researcher and scholar can benefit from this collection of guidance.\\nTafsīr-ul-Mīzan discusses all the topics that are common among contemporary scholars and researchers. These topics are discussed in detail in Tafsīr-ul-Mīzan, such as freedom, social relations, and women\\'s social responsibilities. And rights, issues related to governance in human society, philosophical views on human birth, and imitative aspects of social customs and traditions have been discussed in a very scholarly manner.\\nIn this short article, I have highlighted the author, Tafsīr-ul-Mīzan and its features, and in particular his philosophical discussions. So that it can be beneficial for researchers, teachers, students and the general public. Qur’an emphasizes upon the obedience of Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in several places. The Prophet himself kept his attention towards this. With the revelation of Quran, the Companions had started to act upon Hadith along with Quran. Throughout the history, along with the memorization and compilation the criticism of hadith also continued in its initial and simple forms. Specially after the regime of third caliph Hazrat Uthman (RA), when various political and religious groups started fabrication of Hadith for their purposes, the Muhaddithin started criticism of Hadith, based on the knowledge of Asma ul rijal.\\nThe analysis of chain is base for the identification of fake and fabricated hadiths. It was an unprecedented work in the history of human being. No nation or religion can present such effort. But mostly western Hadith scholars rejected this criticism and set their own criteria to judge the authenticity of hadith. The majority of Western people have accepted it. They believe that their results are research based than early Hadith scholars. This article presents a comparative study of their rules of chain criticism. Nawab Bahadur Yar Jang (1905-1944) was one of the famous leaders of Pakistan Movement, who, as a renowned speaker and orator, did extreme efforts to inspire Muslims of Subcontinent to demand and struggle for a separate piece of land. Religion was a prominent part of his personality and he refreshed the meaning of ideology of Pakistan again and again in the minds of people and the leaders of the Muslim League in this particular dimension. This warrior like leader of Hyderabad Dakkan was well aware of the tricks and traps of hindus. He faced the Shuddhi movement that worked for converting muslims to Hinduism and founded Majlis-e-Tabligh-e-Islam that attempted to work for saving the faith of muslims as well as preaching lslam among non-muslims. Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung was also a prominent member of the Muslim League Planning Committee. This committee presented the social, economic, political and educational structure and work plan for Pakistan according to the teachings and rules of Quran and Sunnah before division of Subcontinent. Main purpose of writing about the services of Nawab Bahadur Yar Jang is to highlight the struggle of the muslims of Subcontinent for their separate homeland and truly perceive the Ideology of Pakistan in the light of sayings and ambitions of the real characters of Pakistan movement, about which confusions and ambiguities are being created. Another important purpose of this article is to bring into the knowledge of new generation that the people struggled for this country had no objective other than Islam. A short survey was conducted among college and university students to see their knowledge about the Ideology of Pakistan and the vision of the leaders of Pakistan movement. Finally, it is concluded that the information about the leaders of Pakistan movement should be included in the syllabus as a part of curriculum. The enemies of Islam ,since earliest times ,have been striving hard to create doubts about the \\'\\'Divine status \\\" of the Holy book of Muslims ,i.e. Quran resulting an\n",

      "109 Ten years ago we focused on the project of starting a law degree Corporate at ESAN University, to lay its foundations and put it, finally, available to young people eager to study a career in quality that combines the classic aspects of law with the introduction knowledge of the field of management and business, as well as the area international with an economic perspective. According to the great objective of make it one of the best options to train corporate lawyers, the desire arose to materialize a work that constituted a space for the reflection, analysis and intellectual production of our teachers, students, researchers or jurists in general. This work researches the welfare economics in the Peruvian material economic constitution through the precedents of the Constitutional Court of Peru. It has as objective to identify the principles and theories that the Constitutional Court uses to resolve conflicts between economic groups. The research will differentiate between material economic constitution and formal economic constitution within of the Peruvian social market economy. The arbitration in our country has been impacted by the decisions of the Constitutional Court. These decisions have had such importance in the arbitration activity, not only because of the content of the interpretations, but because these interpretations have been given the connotation or precedent status. Precisely, it is the reason for this work to present the two precedents that the Court has set in arbitration to reflect on how successful are the rules of jurisprudential creation and how these statements impact on legal security. The present article examines in a preliminary perspective the Kuntur Wasi Case, which is actually been under an Arbitral Tribunal in ICSID. It is focused in the probable perspectives that the present case may take under an analysis that centres in the Peru-Argentina BIT and its Public International Law norms. The general principles of law are a worldview or aspiration that generate guidelines that go beyond the creative work of positive law, covering not only the act generator of the legal norm but also the mechanisms of interpretation and legal integration. However, each area of law is ruled by special principles that are its own and that generate individual characteristics that make them independent. This article seeks to relate the rules that govern the legal transactions with those that deal with the exchange law, trying to demonstrate the singularities inherent in this special area of law, we will start from a historical perspective and culminate in the normative and jurisprudential demonstration, reinforced by dogmatic in both fields of legal knowledge. In the event of a serious breach of obligations, it’s logical the representation that assists the creditor exclusively affected, the possibility of resolve the agreement, for loss of interest in claiming the due; however, to achieve this purpose, the law has the necessary observance of certain requirements, which cannot be ignored within the framework of private autonomy, or because the creditor wants to resolve the agreement unilaterally. It’s precisely the affectation of the indicated interest that makes it possible to distinguish between immediate and deferred resolution procedures, proposing that the so-called intimidation resolution be considered in the last group, given that it’s assumed that the creditor maintains interest in to obtain the due, although it will lose it if, within the granted period, the unfaithful party maintains the state of non-performance of obligations. Being a full-fledged resolution, in which a constitutive jurisdictional qualification is omitted, it should be able to register said resolution, despite the fact that the current registry regulation does not expressly authorize it, for which purpose, warning of contingencies, certain alternatives are proposed for reasonably protect the interests of the parties involved. Intellectuality and politics have been recurrent elements in the management of power, directly or indirectly. The article highlights the influence of the Convictorio de San Carlos (Lima) in strengthening the prevailing regime. From him, we show José Faustino Sánchez Carrión, liberal revolutionary, and Bartolomé Herrera, conservative liberal, each of whom in his time and context had the leadership in politics. A fact that highlights the importance of the contributions of the Study Centers in the management of the country. Due to the enactment of Legislative Decree Nro. 1425, this paper, points out the relevance of the concept of Juridical Accrual in our tax legal system; as well as the parameters that tax payers must take into account for its correct application in their day-to-day operations, which are understood as economic facts giving rise to taxable events subject to the Corporate Income Tax. On this basis, in order to provide the tools for its correct application of the aforesaid concept, we had incorporated into its analysis, required civil law aspects as they are mentioned by the own juridical definition of Accrual. The study reviews some common concepts about Law, such as the paradigm that the person becomes an object with death, laying down in question the traditional idea that the rights of the human being are extinguished with his death, raising the possibility of their recognition through the concept of “transcendent preterit personality” and taking into account the posthumous dignity of the person. To this end, the subject is analyzed both from a theoretical and a practical perspective, offering a more complete perspective in the better defense and protection of the Fundamental Rights, among other issues related to the subject. Currently, international trade is one of the economic activities more outstanding. It does not imply - as the author states - only transfers of goods or services; It also includes a series of elements, among which culture, technology and legal systems are included. For this reason, the international trade has direct effects, through cultural penetration or political interference, both in transnational corporations and in Recipient states and their populations. Sierralta, taking into account these new elements that are affected by economic activity, proposes a new theory: the evolutionary theory of international trade. This is raised not only as a theoretical approach, but also as the development of interdependence between the actors and the time factor in trade. Published in Lima, but with contributions from authors from different countries from Latin America and Europe, this book presents a large part of the works exposed during the IV Peruvian-Franco-German Academic Meeting that in August 2017 brought together the Faculties of Law of the Technische Universität Dresden (Germany), from the Université Paris-Nanterre (France) and the ESAN University around the topic «Security and freedom ». This book consists of thirteen articles in various languages, spread over five chapters representing the current challenges of our democracies contemporary:\\nI. The legal implications of the state of emergency.\\nII. Security and migration borders.\\nIII. Terrorism, a changing threat.\\nIV. Security issues in international law.\\nV. Fight against corruption.\n",
      "110 The study aims to analyse the spin-off policies’ impact on the Islamic banks’ efficiency in Indonesia. The study was conducted on five spin-off Islamic banks and efficiency were measured by the BOPO ratio. The research variables used were dummy spin-off, ROA, FDR, and economic growth. Data analysis used panel data regression on annual data from 2008 to 2018. The results suggest that, first, the implementation of spin-off policy significantly increased the operational efficiency of Islamic banking. Second, ROA also has a negative effect on efficiency. Third, FDR and economic growth have no significant effect on the Islamic banks’ efficiency in Indonesia. Introduction to The Problem: Been established for 282 years (2019), Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri was one of the oldest Islamic educational institutions in Indonesia. With its approximately 11,000 students, the institution was potentially economic to develop. The development effort was started in 1961 by establishing Koperasi Pondok Pesantren which focused on how to fulfill its students’ needs. Kopontren Sidogiri was currently the main actor in a minimarket business competition in East Java. With its trading activities earning IDR 1 trillion per year, Kopontren Sidogiri could give a welfare impact to the community and Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri.Purpose/Objective Study: The research aims to examine Kopontren Sidogiri’s operational description and marketing-mix implementation in retail business in the 4.0 era.Design/Methodology/Approach: The research was conducted using a qualitative method. According to the theme of the discussion, this research was field research. The research was a descriptive case study performed at Koperasi Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri. Sampling was conducted using a purposive sampling technique. The research sample consisted of a steering committee, managers, staff, and experts. The secondary data were collected from several findings relevant to this study. Data validity was tested using a triangulation technique.Findings: Strategies implemented included marketing mix (4Ps) i.e. product, place, price, and promotion. The achievement gave an inclusive and modern image to Koperasi Pesantren. Meanwhile, place strengthening was by building Toko Basmalah in the areas where alumni of Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri lived, creating loyal market targets. Moreover, price strengthening was by using a retail price in a product sale, encouraging the sale, and making effective profits. The promotion was by branding Pondok Pesantren Sidogiri, creating customers’ trust, and spreading positive information about Minimarket Basmallah to people (word of mouth). Halal becomes the lifestyle of Muslim consumers in the world. As the Muslim population increasing, the awareness on consuming halal food also improving. This paper aims to examine the influence of religiosity, halal awareness, halal certification, and food ingredients on purchase intention of halal food among Indonesian Muslim consumers. Convenience sampling was used as the sampling method of this study. This research consisted of 205 respondents. The data are collected by questionnaire which are analyzed by multiple linear regression. The results of this study revealed that religiosity, halal awareness, halal certification and food ingredients have significantly positive effect on purchase intention of halal Food. This study indicates that consuming halal food is primary need for Muslim. Therefore, company should acquire halal certification in order to provide halal food for Muslim’s needs. This study contributed for the research literature, government, food manufacturers and marketers to develop strategies related with halal food. The impact of the Zakat system on human welfare is well established. In India, there is a significant development in terms of localised management of zakat system. However, the targeted delivery of zakat funds, unorganised collections and lack of transparency remain a matter of concern. There is no formal institutional mechanism for efficient Zakat distribution, and problems of circularity are at mostly affecting the progress of welfare mechanisms. Problems of circularity of Zakat funds are still, largely, incoherent and practically disconnected with the mechanics of philanthropic institutions. In our theoretical model, crowdfunding for welfare scheme is being treated as the determinant, which could mediate and alter the performance of zakat welfare. Further, make it more accessible and catering to more comprehensive economic benefits for the community. In this exploratory theoretical paper, we also examine the nature of a common platform for the Zakat distribution. In addition to this, how it could reduce the scrutiny of Government intervention and proper channelisation of Islamic philanthropic activities. This study aims to determine the long-term relationship between stock market and exchange rate in Indonesia. The research method used is Johansen cointegration test. The results of this study found no cointegration between the variables tested. Thus the exchange rate, JII, and IHSG have no relationship in the long term. The fluctuation of the rupiah exchange rate in recent years did not generally affect the performance of stock indices especially after the global financial crisis of 2008. This shows the capital market in Indonesia has a good performance so that it is not so sensitive to the sentiment of the decline in the rupiah against the US dollar. This finding is in line with the findings of Syahrer (2010) which states the exchange rate has no effect on the stock market. Introduction to The Problem: The movement of the Islamic stock index can be influenced by changes in domestic macroeconomic conditions, not only domestic macroeconomics but also influenced by the stock markets of other countries.Purpose/Objective Study: The main objective of this study is to analyze the influence of the domestic macroeconomic and global stock indices on the Indonesian sharia stock index.Design/Methodology/Approach: This study uses a quantitative methodology with secondary data. The data sample method is saturated sample that all members of the population are used to be the research sample. The type of research data is monthly time series with a time period from May 2011 - July 2019, the selection of the Vactor Error Correction Model (VECM) research method based on the stationarity of the data on the first difference and the existence of cointegration models.Findings: The results showed in the short term all variables did not show a significant effect. In the long run, interest rates have a negative effect, while the exchange rate shows a positive effect on the movement of Islamic stock price indexes. Global stock indices such as the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index show a negative effect, and the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 index shows a positive effect. While the Nikkei 225 index did not show a significant effect on the Indonesian Islamic stock index. Research related to the purchase intention of halal products has been the concern of many researchers in recent years. This study aimed to determine the relationships between attitude, halal certification, promotion, and brand related to the intention of purchasing at the halal-certified restaurant. The data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire survey consisting of 132 consumers. We found that the attitude, halal certification, and brand were significantly influential towards the purchase intention at the halal-certified restaurant, whereas a promotion was not significantly influential Introductions to The Problem: Zakat is one of worship which is often mentioned in the Al Quran. It\\'s just that the potential for Zakat, Infaq, Alms (ZIS) is not comparable to the actual actual figures. Many factors influence muzakki in paying ZIS.Purpose/Objective Study: This study aims to analyze the factors that influence muzakki to pay ZIS in zakat institutions, namely Yatim MandiriDesign/ Methodology/ Approach: The sample in this study amounted to 200 respondents. LAZ Yatim Mandiri was chosen because it is an Amil Zakat Institution that is consistent in collecting ZIS funds from the smallest amount to the large amount. This study uses logistic regression analysis and the data used are primary data. Based on the analysis that has been done, it is found that 61% results can be predicted correctly in the logistic regression model in this study.Findings: The consistency of muzakki in paying ZIS at the Yatim Mandiri Amil Zakat Institution is influenced by the variables of religiosity, income, trust, shariah compliance, knowledge, justice, data publication, financial accountability, motivation, the role of ulama, the role of government. And the consistency of muzakki in paying ZIS at the Yatim Mandiri Amil Zakat Institution is not influenced by the variables of shariah compliance and financial accountability. The increasing number of sharia financial institutions in Indonesia is accompanied by an increase in literature review regarding sharia financial institutions. Renewal of studies related to the development of Islamic finance in Indonesia is important to continue. This study aims to examine the factors that affect the level of profitability of Islamic banking in Indonesia in the latest conditions and the latest data. The approach used is quantitative descriptive. Based on the F test, the f-statistic value obtained was 0.000085 below 0.05 (five percent). In other words, the independent variables including CAR, NPF, FDR, and inflation simultaneously have a significant effect on the dependent variable ROA. Whereas in a formal manner, based on the t-test, the NPF variable has a positive and significant effect on ROA. While the CAR, FDR and inflation variables have no effect on ROA. This study seeks to reveal the suitability of Islamic teachings with Good Public Governance (GPG), which in recent decades, has become a concern of various countries in the world. By exploring many reputable references, it is known that there is a match between the governance index published by the World Bank and the teachings of Islam. Practically even OIC has made the issue of good public governance represented by the governance index as a common goal of all its members. However, the facts show that the governance index in various OIC member countries is still relatively low compared to other countries. Therefore, all OIC member countries need to enhance further the implementation of Islamic teachings in the management of the country to produce better governance. Sukuk Ijarah is the most popular sukuk that increase in over the world since its start to introduce in 2001. Not only Muslim country who issued this sukuk, so do Non-Muslim Country such as Germany, Japan and China. However, there is issue that come up due to the non-existence of Shariah compliance in this structure such as the requirement of sukuk doesn’t meet Maqasid Shari’ah perspective. Therefore, the aims of this paper to discuss some issue in sukuk Ijarah and give solution in order to develop Islamic capital market.\n",
      "111 TThe increasing demand for the fruit of the assai palm has generated the need for research to enable higher productivity. A GGE biplot was used to analyze the behavior of 30 assai palm tree genotypes from Anajás city and grown in Tomé-Açu, Pará, in a randomized complete block design, with 30 treatments (progenies G1 until G30), three replicates and five plants per plot in four years (A1 until A4). The following characteristics were evaluated: total weight of bunches (PTC), in grams; total weight of fruit (PTF), in grams; and average weight of 100 fruit (PCF). Obtaining as conclusions that the progenies G10 for PTC and PTF; G19 for large fruits or G25 for “chumbinho” fruits for PCF are closest to the ideotype, with better average performance and also in terms of stability and adaptability; most progenies with higher averages have poor stability in PTC and PTF, differently for PCF whose progenies were very close averages and concentrated in terms of stability; the GGE biplots allow us to visualize of the progenies behavior, of the years, of the interrelationship between progenies and years and identify the superior progenies. By graphical analysis of GGE Biplot the environments contribute more intensely to the interaction G x E in relation to the progenies, highlighting A3 for PTC; A2 for PTF and; A4 to PCF. The years A1 and A2 for PTC; A1 for PTF and; A2 for PCF represent the average from all years. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of foliar application of fungicides to control Phaeosphaeria leaf spot and consequently on the features of the maize crop productivity in the crop year 2014/15. The experimental design was randomized blocks, in a 2x4 factorial scheme, with two hybrids, three treatments + a control in four replications. The treatments were based on the following fungicides (g i.a L-1): epoxiconazole + pyraclostrobin (333 + 167); cyproconazole + picoxystrobin (80 + 200); azoxystrobin + benzovinliflupyr (300 + 150), which were applied in BG7051H and BG7060HR hybrids with knapsack/ manual sprayer, pressurized with CO2 in the phenological stage of culture V8, 70 days after seeding (70 DAS). The experimental plot had four rows spaced at 0.50 m and length of 10.0 m, resulting in a total area of 20 m2 and useful area of 8 m2, which held the white spot severity assessments, grain yield (kg ha-1) and thousand grain weight (g). Significant differences were observed for all fungicides compared to the control. The control alone had the highest severity index compared to the other treatments. Regarding the thousand grain weight and productivity (kg ha-1), the azoxystrobin + solatenol treatment was superior to the control and other treatments with fungicides, with a higher production of grain compared to the control. The present study evaluated the biostimulating effect on seed germination and initial vegetative development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. bean seedlings in response to the application of the aqueous extract of Osmundaria obtusiloba (C. Agardh) RE Norris (Rhodophyta) and Sargassum vulgare C. Agardh Ochrophyta), relating the activity with the contents of proteins and carbohydrates of extracts. Seaweed dried biomass of macroalgae were extracted at the concentration of 500 g L-1 in distilled water, this concentration was considered 100%. After was prepared in dilutions of 25%, 50%, and 0% (negative control) for each species. The experiment was conducted with 140 bean seeds in transparent plastic boxes kept in incubators under a12 hour photoperiod at the temperature of 25°C for 15 days. During this time, the germination percentage, germination speed and vigor of the seedlings (shoot length x radicle length) were assessed, as well as the sugar and total protein content of each seaweed extract. The results indicated that the development of seedling aerial biomass was 1.8 times higher with the extract at 25% concentration of O. obtusiloba than with the negative control. There were no changes in the germination parameters. Therefore, the O. obtusiloba extract showed a more positive effect on initial development than that of S. vulgare. The O. obtusiloba extract contained 160 mg L-1 while that of S. vulgare contained 80 mg L-1 total soluble proteins, indicating that protein content might be indicative of seaweed potential for application in agriculture. Agroindustrial wastes in southeastern Amazon are abundant and there are policies encouraging proper disposal for such wastes for sustainable agriculture. In this study we compared the chemical parameters of composts resulting from composting and vermicomposting sheep manure added to agroindustrial wastes as a bulking agent. Piles of compost were created using sheep manure, fruit waste, and a bulking agent. The treatments consisted of compost piles of: Tc - sheep manure and fruit pulp; Ta - sheep manure, fruit pulp and triturated açaí seeds; Ts - sheep manure, fruit pulp and sawdust, and Tb - sheep manure, fruit pulp and babassu coconut residue. After 50 days, a fraction of the compost from each pile was transferred to vermireactors to compare processes. At the end of the experiment, samples were taken in triplicate from all treatments in both composting and vermicomposting units for chemical analysis. The assessed variables were daily temperature of compost piles and vermireators, C/N ratio, Volatile solids (VS), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), boron (B). Sawdust-based and babassu-based compost, from composting process, has the lower time for stabilization (about 40 days), pH closer to neutral and more efficient in reducing the C:N ratio than vermicomposts. Vermicomposting process increased the concentration of almost all nutrients in treatments, except for babassu-based compost.\n",
      "112 Contrary to the World Bankâ€™s 1979 Bergâ€™s recommendation that countries like Nigeria should focus more on funding primary rather than tertiary education, and the consequent â€˜erraticâ€™ funding allocation before 1999, the funding of higher education in Nigeria since 1999, though lower in comparison with other African nations, receives a much higher share of national resources. This is in addition to the encouragement and licensing of private universities and the establishment of the National Open University to increase access as well as enhance the delivery of tertiary education. Ironically, a cursory observation shows that, in spite of these modest attempts, studentsâ€™ â€˜brain drainâ€™ seems to be on the increase. More and more Nigerian students are heading abroad to pursue undergraduate and graduate degrees. While recognizing the possible socio-economic background of these migrants, it is equally important to appreciate the economic and socio-political implications for the country and the continent â€“ for now and in the future. Consequently, its the aim of the article to expose the possible negative consequences of students â€˜brain drainâ€™ in terms of the possible pitfalls ofÂ preferring the Diasporas to local experts in development purposes. It concludes that except this phenomenon is contained, through policies on attitudinal change, development and democracy would be difficult. The New Partnership for Africa\\'s Development is a pledge by African Leaders based on a common vision and a firm, shared conviction that they have a pressing duty to eradicate poverty and place their countries, both individually and collectively on a path of sustainable growth and development and to participate actively in the world economy and politics (NEPAD, 2001). The paper uses the political economy theory to examine the philosophy of the New Partnership for Africa\\'s Development and the policy has been able to attract foreign direct investment. The research relies on secondary sources of data for the purpose of evaluating the successes and failures of NEPAD. The paper recommends that regional integration be strengthen to enhance economy interaction among African States and conflict prevent mechanism be strengthen to reduce persistence conflict in Africa, to encourage foreign investment in the region. KeywordsNEPAD, Foreign Direct Investment, development, poverty, underdevelopment Education represents the cornerstone of the society and the major instrument through which it can attain accelerated development. To date, there is not any acceptable measurement of formal education other than examination. It is however unfortunate that this globally embraced yardstick has been abused and compromised through examination malpractice. The main objective of this paper is to emphasize the essence of education in the society, examine the concept of examination malpractice, identify its causes and document its negative effects on the society. Generally, expository methodology was used for the study while historical approach was resorted to where necessary.The paper finds that although there are no categorical Islamic texts on examination malpractice, there are various Qur\\'anic and Prophetic texts that condemn cheating, deceit, and non-fulfillment of obligations which are manifestations of examination malpractices. Based on the above, the paper suggests God-consciousness, better funding of education and more pro-active participation of parents as measures that would serve as antidote to this educational bane. Â KeywordsExamination, malpractices, Islam, Muslim, cheating, morality Performance Management System is said to have been developed and implementedresulting in the failure to deliver the results people expect from it.Â The main objective of the paper is to examine the effect of Performance Management System (PMS) on Employeesâ€™ Attitude in the Nigerian Banking Sector. Stratified Sampling Technique were used to select a total number of 180 staff from Head Offices of the 15 listed Banks in Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Data obtained were analysed and presented using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Correlation and regression analysis were used to test the hypotheses formulated for the study. The findings revealed that R2 of 0.2177, 0.4066 and 0.6687 values suggested that variables in the model are all jointly significantly influence the probability of the Nigerian banking sector performing better. The study concluded that the implementation of PMS is said to be the commencement of changed attitude to work due to continuous and systematic assessment of employeesâ€™ performance on a regular basis. The study recommended that; management should continue to communicate the importance of Performance Management System (PMS) to employees until the process is entrenched.Keywords Performance management, performance management system, employees, attitude,Nigerian banking sector, performance indicator Â For any nation to experience growth and accelerated development, conscious efforts have to be made in terms of socio-economic inclusion of the entire citizenry, good governance and ensuring justice in all spheres. This paper advocates some Islamic elements of governance and economic blueprint as panacea for development that will culminate to a harmonious communal living devoid of sectional schisms and economic exploitation of the majority by the few. The Islamic institutions of Zakaat (Compulsory Annual Charity), Sadaqah (Voluntary Alms), Kaffaarah (Atonement Feeding) and Zakaatul-Fitr (End-of-Ramadhan Charity) that are effective instruments of redistribution of wealth and bridging the gap between the affluent and the destitute were proposed for adoption by Sub-Saharan Africa in order to achieve the much sought national reconciliation, economic prosperity and survival justice for all. The paper concludes that it is only through good governance and economic emancipation of people that genuine progress and real nationhood can be achieved. Keywords Good governance, Sadaqah, economic prosperity, Zakaat, Zakaatul-Fitr, empowerment Multinational corporations (MNCs) are key actors in contemporary International economic relation. Moreover, the motivations for Multinational corporations (MNCs) in Africa have generated debate in the literature. The aim of this study is to identify the dimensions of Multinational corporations (MNCs) involvement in corruption in Africa. However, secondary data such as text books, Journals and Internet sources were used in this study. Besides, content analysis was employed in its analysis while the Oligopoly theory was adopted. Also, it was observed that some Multinational corporations (MNCs) in Africa such as Halliburton in Nigeria, Mabey &amp; Johnson in countries such as Ghana, Madagascar, Angola, Mozambique and South Africa among others have been involved in various corrupt practices in some countries in Africa in collaboration with corrupt government officials. Lastly, to combat corrupt practices involving Multinational corporations (MNCs) and government officials in Africa requires concerted efforts from both the home and host country. Keyword Â Corruption, multinational corporations (MNCs), government officials, Africa,international collaboration AbstractGovernance is such a daunting task that requires reciprocal efforts of both the governors and the governed. This explains why governments in all political systems develop legitimation strategies aimed at enlisting the support of the people for their â€˜developmental projectsâ€™. This study examines legitimation efforts of successive administrations in post-colonial Nigeria through Mass Mobilization initiatives. The study, which adopts historical cum comparative methods of investigation and analysis, finds that while successive regimes in Nigeria have resorted to mobilization strategies including creation of agencies to earn legitimacy, certain regimes politicized their mobilization programmes turning them into instruments of political vendetta thereby negating the stated objectives of the mobilization efforts. The study concludes by proposing some measures capable of enhancing the integrity and effectiveness of mobilization strategies in Nigeria. Â KeywordsNigeria, politics, mass mobilisation, governing elites, anti-graft agencies AbstractQuestions and concerns have been raised about the fear-generating potentials of mass media in Nigeria in the face of the rising rate of crime in the country. The public, it is argued, suffer from hysteria about crime fanned up by newspapers and television.Hence, the influence of the mass media in escalating crime for the purpose of impacting on public policies has continued to be the focal point of discussion by criminologists. This paper contributes to literature by expanding knowledge on the relationship between fear of crime and media consumption in Nigeria. The main objective of the paper is to examine the modifiers of the relationships between media and fear. The suitability of cultivation theory in accounting for the influence of the media on the social perception of fear in the country was also examined. The study draws on the literature of risk perception and risk communication, as well as secondary data on the aetiology of fear and public beliefs about crime in a survey of Criminal Victimisation and Safety conducted by CLEEN Foundation. It concludes that most Nigerians do not have scientific foundation for their belief about crime as they are often fed with information about crime from media sources that may not appreciate nor care about the (in)accuracy of that information and that may use crime to entertain sell, advertise, exploit, or win patronage. Given the ubiquity of messages about crime in our society and the costs of inaccurate information, the study proposes that criminal justice officials- the police and other security agents should provide the mass media and by extension, the public with reliable information about crime, including information about the risk of victimisation for different criminal offences.Â KeywordsCrime, cultivation theory, fear, risk, victimisation AbstractThe study examined the relationship between foreign direct investment and financial development in Nigeria for the period 1980 to 2015. Using the vector error correction model (VECM) technique, the study observed a negative relationship existed between financial market development and foreign direct investment in the long run while in the short run, a positive relationship existed between financial market development and foreign direct investment in Nigeria over the estimated period of 1980-2015. Therefore, the study recommended further development of the Nigerian financial market by the monetary authority given its positive influence on the inflows of foreign direct investment in the short run. There is also the need for more financial reform of the Nigerian financial system in order to bring more foreign direct investment into the country both in the long and short runs.Â Keywords Â Financial development, Foreign Direct Investment, VECM, Nigeria AbstractA countryâ€™s exchange rate and balance of payment are usually regarded as one of the indicator by which a nationâ€™s strength can be measured especially its economic strength. Exchange rate plays a major role in international trade because no nation can remain in autarky due to varying factor endowments. Nigerian economy experienced chronic deficit on the balance of payment account, fall in the price of Naira and grossdomestic product growth rate due to over-dependency on imported products, relianceÂ of revenues from oil exports, massive imports of refined petroleum, and other related products. The study evaluates the causality effect of foreign exchange rate and Nigeria balance of payment between the periods of 1970 and 2015. The data obtained were subjected to VECM Granger Causality method of analysis. The results revealed thatexchange rate and balance of payment granger cause each other at 5% level of significance. The study recommended that there should be a restriction on trade openness of goods or services that can be produced locally and diversification of Nigerian economy by the economy managers. The study concluded that there is high propensity for Nigerian economy to achieve favourable balance of payment, if the above recommendations are implemented. AbstractOil as a resource has always introduced a departure to the international structure. This is because the Northern developed nations are deficient in reserves and production of oil vis-Ã -vis the Southern developing nations. In essence, the North is dependent on the South, in a particular relationship between them, thus representing a totally new dimension in North-South relations. In view of the very important fact that the North was not particularly comfortable with the change in status-quo, there have been repeated efforts at reducing, if not totally eliminating, an oil dependency on the South. It has continued to be necessary that the extent at which the dependency is still in place be investigated and rigorously analysed.Â KeywordsNorth-South relations, oil, politics, dependency\n",

But at this time in various countries in the world there is an outbreak of Covid-19 which has a major impact on all aspects. In Indonesia a system has been set up aimed at suppressing the expansion of the Covid-19 outbreak by implementing a Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) system. Large-scale social restrictions are restrictions on certain activities of residents in an area suspected of being infected with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-191 in such a way as to prevent the possibility of spreading Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-I9). Large-scale Social Restrictions must be based on epidemiological considerations, the magnitude threats, effectiveness, support of resources, operational technical, political, economic, social, cultural, defense and security considerations.The impact of the PSBB is strongly felt in aspects of the existing transportation system, therefore there is a need to study \\\"Jabodetabek Transportation System in the Cons PSBB \\\". This research uses descriptive analysis. This method is used to identify the impacts that are influenced by factors that are happening.&nbsp;Based on the analysis that has been done, it is known that the Jabodetabek transportation system service during the PSBB implementation based on the existing influence factor is the public transportation system in Jabodetabek felt the overall impact such as railroad tracks, public buses, conventional taxis and online taxis and motorcycle taxis. This public transportation service system is limited in terms of operating time and passenger restrictions, so this condition is not good for many people because it also impacts on the weakening of the economy, reduction in transportation modes and passenger congestion. So that this condition is not good in various aspects, but the influence factor is aimed at suppressing the spread of Covid-19 which is still endemic in Indonesia, especially in the Jabodetabek area which has become a red zone.&nbsp;The decrease in the number of passengers occurred since January 2020, starting on April 15, 2020 the number of passengers decreased significantly, namely 78.70% in KRL, 90.12% in TransJakarta, 94.12% in MRT, 93.05% in LRT, 64.71% in Taxi and 58.33% in taxibike.\\n&nbsp;Keywords: Transportation System, Covid-19 Impact, Large-Scale Social Limitation. The high rate of growth of the construction sector in Indonesia has not been matched by its level of success.

In addition to the high season period, namely the Eid Mubarak, school holidays, and Hajj and Umrah this year, it is estimated that there will be no increase in the number of passengers. In March 2020 there was a decrease in hotel room occupancy by 20.64% of YoY. This decline figure is interpreted to continue to decline due to the prohibition of going home due to an increase in hotel occupancy rates in Lebaran and school holidays which in previous years could increase by up to 10%. Unemployment in DIY rose 0.52% to 3.38 % from the previous 2.86%. The potential increase in unemployment nationally can occur between 4.25 million people to 9.35 million people.

About 71% students and college students in the city of Yogyakarta use private vehicles daily. The main solution to overcome this in Yogyakarta is by improving the quality of public transportation. Students are reluctant to use public transportation because their residential area is not yet reached by Trans Jogja. The purpose of this study is to analyze the need to add bus stops that are suitable for students in the Urban Aglomeration Area of Yogyakarta in order to increase the student\\'s desire to use Trans Jogja, so that it is expected to reduce congestion. The results of this study indicate that the distance between the school or campus to a bus stop has already met the standard, but there are still as many as 9% of students whose school or campus\\'s location is within &gt;400 meters to the bus stop. Meanwhile, the distance from the house to the bus stops does not meet the standards because as many as 45% of students whose house location is within &gt; 400 meters to the bus stop. So Trans Jogja need to add additional stops around residential houses and around schools or campuses to increase the number of students to use Trans Jogja as many as 330 bus stop points consisting of 267 existing bus stops and 63 new bus stops.\\nKeywords: trans jogja, bus stop, public transportation Concrete is a material widely used in construction projects. The quality of concrete is strongly influenced by some of its constituent materials such as water, cement, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates and other additives. In the implementation of construction using concrete, there is a great deal of damage to concrete materials, one of which is porous or with other names voids (cavities or holes). Therefore, repair methods used for occurring damage in concrete are needed. This study used a 15cmx15cmx15cm cube-shaped concrete sample divided into three samples, namely 6 cubes of normal concrete, 6 cubes of concrete made intentionally porous with grouting method using Sikagrout215, and concrete which was intentionally made porous with a method of grouting using a mixture of cement and water (cement paste) 6 cubes. Each cube were tested its compressive strength at the stage of 7, 21 and 28 days. The results showed that the cause of porous concrete was caused by several factors including cement water factor, lack of compaction process, the aggregate ratio used, and poor workability. Concrete compressive strength results at 28 days showed that the compressive strength of normal concrete was 230,459 kg / cm², concrete grouting with 215 cycles of 318,532 kg / cm², and grouting concrete with a mixture of cement and water 316,707 kg / cm². Grouting concrete using 215 cycles has the largest value among the three samples. Hence, in this study the grouting method is the right choice to make porous concrete repaired.\\nKeywords: porous concrete, grouting, concrete compressive strength, column, structure&nbsp; Fire disaster is one of the disasters that is very detrimental to the community both in terms of casualties and property and assets that are invaluable.

Marxism (and its political history, which cannot be reduced to crime nor completely justified in the name of an ideal) still offers us a critical-conceptual apparatus, able to analyze the concrete reality of our times with lucidity and accuracy. The quality of its methodology and tools is the most important inheritance of Marx and Engels’ lesson. In this perspective, we absolutely need to keep philosophical criticism and historical memory together. This choice implies the loss of that side of Marxism that indulges to philosophical-ideological predictions (and therefore to forms of prophetism) and the pursuit of a critical theory of society that, thanks to Gramsci’s indication, gives us a dynamic conception of history. A conception that moves from the objectivity of history, but at the same time emphasizes the role of subjectivity and its freedom.Keywords: Progress; Historicism; Marxism; Gramsci. After the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, an attitude spread inside Marxist movements and parties, according to which every mass movement of the subaltern classes was celebrated as an ascetic redemption of the “last” and of the “poor” men, while every prosaic and “bourgeois” demand for a development of the productive forces was ignored, in a sort of messianic wait for a bourgeois society\\'s palingenesis. Antonio Gramsci was reluctant towards this tendency. He was interested instead in building and defending the new revolutionary State (Bolsheviks as a sort of “aristocracy of statesman”), being aware of the arduous and contradictory process of construction of the new social order. Hence it springs the concern of Italian historical materialism in phenomena such as Americanism and Fordism and towards the industrial production’s techniques of organization. A concern shared by Gramsci with Lenin, according to whom the revolutionary State needs to assimilate every scientific achievement as a useful tool to ensure the development of the Soviet country and to overcome a generalized misery and a backwardness that endangered its survival.Keywords: Populism; Pauperism; Americanism; Fordism; Historical Materialism. The young Croce conceives a historical materialism as a realistic reading of the historical world that is very different from the model of natural sciences. This idea of historical materialism, born of a neo-Kantian idea, can be renewed today in a perspective that, like the one we propose here and according to some Marx’s suggestions, thinks the concrete human understanding as a form of “reproduction (reproduzieren)”. This new “realistic” historical materialism is a radical criticism of that sort of metaphysical-materialistic economicism involved in the ideology of contemporary financial capitalism. This is an ideology that compels men to self-conceive themselves as “type specimens” of a supreme Law, the Law of a new Providence: the “markets”.Keywords: Historical realism; Conceptual reproduction of reality; Financial capitalism; Market as Providence. In the era of “high tech capitalism”, an era involving a progressive automation of production processes, we need a reading of Marx that reconnects his early works with those of his maturity and with some Engels’ key-texts, including the Dialectics of Nature. Today this reading is indispensable in order to think the current historical phase in its complexity. Against the apologists of a post-human robotics, it is necessary to build a new form of humanism, related to a practical dialectics that is the only true alternative to metaphysics. Only in this way, in the technological era, we will be able to understand society and nature not as abstractly splitted, but in their differentiated relationship, in view of a suitable form of praxis.Keywords: Marx; Dialectics; Technology; Humanism; Philosophy of praxis. This paper aims at discussing the causes and the effects of the disappearance of Marxism in teaching and reasearch in Italian Universities, with particular reference to political economy. It will be argued that this phenomenon is linked to the restructuring of the Italian capitalism and, particularly, to a political demand – on the part of firms – of applied research and the espulsion of the political and critical dimension from the economic thinking.Keywords: Marxism, Italian University, Italian capitalism. Developing itself under the sign of neoliberalism and working for the sole pursuit of economic profit (with results whose evidence is there for everyone to see), the globalization of capitalism challenges our political thought. We need to understand that carrying on along the path of unlimited growth and according to today\\'s dominant paradigms, we can witness a worsening of a situation that is already clearly unsustainable. The paradigm of gift, as identified by Mauss in his accusation of the “homo oeconomicus”, can be now the backbone of a new and “lateral” form of universalism (Merleau-Ponty). That is, for a sort of “pluriversalism” in which human affections and passions can acquire a new centrality, helping us in a re-institutionalization of the public space. Giving to our time a comprehensive vision of history, the new philosophy that we can call “convivialism” allow us to understand and live the global era, whit its endless alterations but also with its great opportunities.Keywords: Globalization; Gift; Mauss; Convivialism. “Materialism,” which is central for Marxism, is apparently less important for Marx, who, after the “Theses on Feuerbach,” only rarely mentions it. In Capital, Marx mentions “materialism” only two times: in a passage on Giambattista Vico, an important eighteenth Italian philosopher, and in the Afterword to the second German edition in the famous comment on Hegelian dialectic. This paper concerns the reference to Vico. This reference is important in two ways: in calling attention to a basic similarity between Marx’s position and Vico’s constructivist approach to knowledge, and in suggesting Marx’s position is not science but rather a particular kind of philosophy.Keywords: Marx; Vico; Materialism; Hegel; Capital. In order to adequately deal with Gramsci\\'s view of education, we can\\'t remove the constitutive link of this theme with another issue, so crucial for him: the question of hegemony. We need therefore to quote the original debate that, in the second half of the Twentieth century, fixed the crucial importance of this term. But we need also to pursue our analysis of Gramsci\\'s work in a rigorous diachronic perspective, looking at the whole evolution and route of his thought. Only in this way we can avoid partial interpretations of the question of hegemony. A partiality that fails the authentic perspective of Gramsci\\'s pedagogy: emancipation, in a strong and universal sense that is strictly linked to philosophy of praxis.Keywords: Gramsci; Education; Hegemony; Philosophy of praxis. In the age of globalization, Althusser’s thought can be a compass that allows us to find points of reference in a situation where the sense of history appears as unthinkable (precisely because impossible). Althusser (about which we don’t need more to distinguish a first and a second phase) defined our age as a “without a center” one. An era that forces us to leave every idealistic residual in classical historical materialism, i.e. the idea of human essence, and a teleology of history and of its necessary course (determinism). On the contrary, moving from Althusser and its uninterrupted critical dialogue with Machiavelli and Gramsci, we need to conceive a “materialism of the encounter” that is also an “aleatory” one. A materialism whose central conceptual category, the idea of “conjuncture”, in force of its constitutive provisional nature, can help us to act in our world. A world marked by a continuous and unforeseeable becoming, that rejects any aprioristic analysis.Keywords: Althusser; Globalization; Materialism of the encounter; Aleatory materialism; Conjuncture. We present a diplomatic transcription (and a photographic reproduction) of the autograph draft of a detailed memory about the historian Jules Michelet, written a few days after his death by a journalist and politician who had assiduously frequented him between 1859 and 1867. The author, Pierre Denis, who played a non-marginal role during the Paris Commune, proves to be an attentive observer able to capture the essential elements of the personality and the method of a man considered “father of the historiography of France”. He provides us a portrait of this man and his time, lively and rich in insights. It is particularly interesting the Denis’ appreciation of Balzac’s works, a judgment that has strong analogies with Marx’s and Engels’ opinion, (the Comedié humaine as a “realistic history of French society”).Keywords: Denis; Michelet; Balzac; Marx; French social history. From Telesio Interlandi to Julius Evola, fascist anti-Semitism revealed an almost non existent relationship with the political culture of the French anti-Semitism. Exponents of the French anti-Semitism of the late nineteenth century, starting with Drumont, remained unknown to the most important theorists of fascist racism. This stance is due to different reasons. Meanwhile, French anti-Semitism, from Drumont to Maurras, had a strong anti-German characterization. This characterization was in contrast to fascist pro-German policy. Moreover, fascist anti-Semitism was one of the most politically radical voices of the territorial expansionism of the regime, claiming colonies (Tunisia) and French territories (Corsica). It started mainly from 1939, with anthropological and racial justifications. The only theorist of French anti-Semitism to find space in the political journalism of the regime was Georges Montandon, exponent of the pro-Nazi collaborationism. However, Montandon\\'s thesis didn\\'t find space in the fascist debate on race, because his racism, with a strong ideological inclination, was considered to be in contrast to the \\\" spiritual racism\\\" of the regime.Keywords: Fascist antisemitism; Territorial expansionism; Antisemitic criticism of democracy; Georges Montandon.\n",

Keywords Consumption, Disposable Income, Interest Rates, Saving, Money Supply, Income Taxes and Inflation Islam anticipates economic development which is considered as part of human development. Its essence is that it enables humans to control the economic environment and improve the quality of life. There are four basic teachings of Islam that deal with the philosophy of Islamic economic development: tawhîd, rubûbiyah, khalîfah and tazkiyah. In this study, using the literature review method, namely using a theory that is relevant to the research problem of Islamic Economic Development Strategies in the Covid-19 Period. The results showed that the principle of tawhid is to prevent concentrated economic power. Khalîfah The principle is to protect against environmental damage and to protect the conservation of natural resources. The principle of tazkiyah to prohibit social inequality and promote equality and justice. In line with that, it can form a continuity of development. The concept of continuity building is basically the application of the rubûbiyah principle, it is the principle of education, maintenance, and continuity of perfection, as a divine (divine) principle. Therefore, if these four principles are realized in Indonesia\\'s development economy, the government will easily create a prosperous and just nation. Then the development strategies offered in the framework of the Islamic economic concept and system are: (1) by distributing direct cash assistance originating from zakat, donations and alms; (2) by strengthening waqf in the form of cash waqf, productive waqf, waqf linked sukuk and waqf for infrastructure; (3) through superior business capital assistance for the business sector or Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); (4) through the qardhul hasan scheme; (5) increasing Islamic economic and financial literacy; (6) through the development of Islamic financial technology. &nbsp; Keywords: Development strategy, Islamic Economics, Pandemic Covid-19 &nbsp; One of the programs carried out by the Muhammadiyah Organization through the Muhammadiyah Covid-19 Command Center (MCCC) is the Muhammadiyah Family Food Security Movement (Getapak).

      "117 This research aims to examine the construction of the discourse of religious and moral values within the official English textbook for Indonesian high school students and to expose the underlying ideology. The textbook analyzed is the official English textbook for junior high school grade VII, Bahasa Inggris: When English Rings the Bell. This study makes use of Fairclough’s three dimensional models, namely textual, processing, and socio-cultural analysis. In the level of textual analysis, the researcher addresses the issues of transitivity and modality. In the processing stage, the focus is on the issue of assumption. Meanwhile, the ideology investigation is done in the last level. The findings shows that the discourse of the religious and moral values are classified into four main categories: values toward one’s self (e.g being disicpline regarding the time), values toward others (e.g loving them and being attentive to their occupation and physical appearance), values toward animals (i.e. loving and being attentive to them), and values toward things around (i.e. being attentive to them). The Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) investigation reveals that the discourse of religious and moral values within this book represents some dominating ideologies, such as the western-secular way of greeting people, the outschool activites of the mid-high social class, the rich’s-style house furniture, and the notion that beauty is identical with white skin and straight hair, the capitalism-driven economics system, as well as the idea of woman emancipation by the feminist movement. This research is a literary criticism which uses psychological approach. It employs a literary criticism because the writer conducts discussion of literary works which is related with the personality of the main character in the Beastly film namely Kyle Kingson. The findings showed that there are five symptoms of depression from the main character Kyle Kingson namely, (1) feeling sad or unhappy, (2) loss of interest or pleasure daily activity that be loved before, (3) easy to be angry or easy to be offended, (4) difficult to take decision, less to concentrate, (5) feeling worthless, guilty and always thinking about past failures. Moreover, Kyle can solve his depression by himself and Zola and Will make Kyle confidence with his ugly face. Questioning is mostly conducted in learning process. As the reasons, by giving questions, teacher engages communicative interaction with students in classroom. But sometimes the communication can run effectively. The participants ordinary, broke the communication roles. This research investigates violation of maxims on students’ responses toward teacher question and determines the dominant type of maxim which is violated on students’ responses. This research was conducted qualitative research. And the research found that there were three types of maxim that were violated on students maxim of quantity, maxim of quality and maxim of manner. Then, maxim of quantity was mostly violated on students’ responses. This article aims to examine the main factors that causing gender injustice among female workers in Kampung Songket, Indralaya, Ogan Ilir, South Sumatra. The results of this study indicate that the main cause of gender injustice in Kampung Songket’s women is culture of the law factors, namely family background and local culture. As for the other factors, namely the substance of the law, both from the understanding of the texts of the Koran and Sunnah and positive legal material, are not very influential. As an implication of this double burden, the position of Kampung Songket’s women is increasingly strong in determining assets according to the provisions of Article 35 paragraph (1) of Law No. 1 of 1974 concerning Marriage and based on the Compilation of Islamic Law in Chapter XIII Article 85 - Article 97. The Muslims in Indonesia, they appreciate the tradition’s value so much, remarkably, the one which becomes the part of the religiousity practices and becomes one with it. Therefore, the Islamic religion manifestation in every community group is different, because of the tradition’s differences cover it; the position of tradition and the ancestors precepts which are placed equally with religion,it is toward the invisible matter or supernatural. Their exiatences are worshipped, honored, respected and even considdered cult, treated as the God in religion. Supernatural is often anthropomorphic, it means that the supernatural is often treated as the other creatures which have the ability and characters like human, animals, or plants. The community divinity concept and perception is not purely monotheism, but it is monopluralistic. Tradition which is accomodated by the in their religious practices is often connected to the myth existence in it. The myth truth is the community faith matter, emotion and mental. All of the religion processes related to doctrine, history and its development can not be separated from the existence of the myth, included religion which is claimed as the revelation religion. The myth element becomes very important in this contextual Islam, because the myth knowledge is considered as the holy story, the primordialic event about the universe genesis, the past time, and the other life. Frazer describes that the myth position in the community religion, is like the holy book in the modern religion. In every tribe and group who claim as Muslim, they have the myth practices which become the base in arrenging local Islamic practices. In the study of anthropology and sociology, the function and the role of myth, religion, and tradition can not be substancially distinguished, since everyone contains the invisible element. The myth as a story which is considered sacred as like the holy book which is able to describe the transendental primordial event. Myth is related to the traditional religion and the holy book is related to modern religion. The Sociology defines that myth is as the social stucture in creating the community condition. As a belief which is able to strengthen the community mystical side in order to be able to conserve the adhesive social values in the community. Writing is difficult for English Department students in Indonesia. Students commonly have low ability to write and have very limited time to practice this skill. To overcome students’ problems in writing, the use of peer assessment can be an appropriate way to improve fluency in writing since this research is held to: (1) elaborate the roles of peer assessment to build fluency in writing classes, (2) identify the types of activity in writing class by implementing peer assessment, (3) explore the strengths of peer assessment to build fluency in writing, and (4) to prove the effectiveness of peer assessment to build fluency in writing.This is a mixed method research. The subjects of this research are nine students of TI.B class in academic years 2016/ 2017. To collect the data, some instruments such as field note, observation, documentation and test were used. Interactive analysis and statistical analysis (t-test) were applied to analyze quantitative data. Furthermore, statistical analysis using SPSS 20 used to analyze quantitative data.The results of the research are: (1) the use of peer assessment minimizes students’ apprehension in writing, (2) constructive activities are important to lead students in conducting active and critical learning, (3) peer assessment is meaningful to build students to be authentic writers and readers, (4) peer assessment is effective to build students’ fluency in writing indicated by the result of hypothesis test. It is widely believed that English Foreign Language (EFL) learners need to develop their language proficiency by getting so much input. Moreover, students need to be familiarized with the real English us­age where real forms of communication and cultural knowledge are crucially exposed. Teaching through authentic materials will make the learners feel that they are learning a real language which is used by the real native speakers for real communication. incorporating au­thentic materials helps students acquire an effective communicative competence in the language focus. The research intended to describe the implementation of authentic materials in extensive reading class, the problems arise and the students’ responses toward the authen­tic materials in extensive reading class. The design of the research was Descriptive Qualitative method and the research subject was the lecturer of Extensive Reading class and 33 students in B class of the fourth semester of STAIN Ponorogo who took Extensive Read­ing subject. The instruments used were in the form of observation sheet, interview guideline and questionnaire. The implementation of authentic materials in extensive reading class covered some procedures into three main phases namely (1) Pre­ Activity, (2) Main­ Activity and (3) Post­Activity. The activities in main activity are as follows: (a) Pre­ Activity; (b) Whilst ­Activity; and (3) The language focus stage. There were problems arose during the implementation in terms of complicated planning, more time allocation and some disinterested students. Finally, the students showed significantly positive attitude toward the implementation of authentic materials in extensive reading class.

      "119 Biosurfactants are derived from plants and microorganisms such as fungi, yeast, and bacteria. Biosurfactants are also called natural surfactants which are amphiphilic biological compounds comprised of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. The environmental concerns about the effect of toxic and conventional surfactants have increased the demand for renewable and biodegradable surfactants with low toxicity and other useful effects. Therefore, the application of biosurfactants has gained much attention in different industries mainly in petroleum, food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. This review summarizes the utilization of biosurfactants as emulsifying, wetting, foaming and antimicrobial agents in various industrial processes along with their promising availability and ensuring environmental quality. The effect of CO2 partial pressure on ethanol dry reforming was evaluated over 5%Ce-10%Co/Al2O3 catalyst at = PCO2 = 20-50 kPa, PC2H5OH = 20 kPa, reaction temperature of 973 K under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was prepared by using impregnation method and tested in a fixed-bed reactor. X-ray diffraction measurements studied the formation of Co3O4, spinel CoAl2O4 and CeO2, phases on surface of 5%Ce-10%Co/Al2O3 catalyst. CeO2, CoO and Co3O4 oxides were obtained during temperature–programmed calcination. Ce-promoted 10%Co/Al2O3 catalyst possessed high BET surface area of 137.35 m2 g-1. C2H5OH and CO2 conversions was improved with increasing CO2 partial pressure from 20-50 kPa whilst the optimal selectivity of H2 and CO was achieved at 50 kPa. Emulsions have been widely used in different industrial processes. The development and production of good quality emulsions depend on the knowledge of emulsion preparation, stability mechanisms and rheological studies. To form stable emulsions, an emulsifier is required to reduce the droplet sizes of the emulsions and enhance the emulsion stability. The purpose of this review article is to provide information about types of emulsions, stability mechanisms and rheological studies as well as factor affecting the stability of emulsions. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is credible and promising technology methods for industrial wastewater treatment and recycle it to use in different applications. Today MBR has many domestic and industrial applications and it is popular among the types of conventional treatment methods. The main drawback in the operation of MBR is membrane fouling, that drive to the decrease in permeate flux so need some technique to clean the membrane. In spite of more than a decade of significant advances in improvement of fouling reduction technique, various physical and mechanical methods are still necessary to be improved to limit the membrane fouling problems. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of membrane bioreactor, fundamental of membrane fouling that is affected by some factors and methods of controlling membrane fouling were discussed. Emulsions can be found in different industries such as petroleum, food, cosmetic and pharmaceutics. Generally, there are two types of emulsions in petroleum industries: water-in-oil (W/O) and oil-in-water (O/W). The aim of this research was to evaluate the stability of W/O emulsions using different emulsifiers such as Span 80, Span 83, Triton-x-100, DEA, and LSWR with different concentrations (1.5 and 2.5) vol%. All the emulsions were prepared at (20-80) vol% and 2000 rpm. The result of this study showed that the most stable emulsions were prepared by Span 80. However, LSWR formed the most unstable emulsions. In addition, it was also found that the concentration of emulsifier can significantly affect the emulsion stability. Distillation is an essential thermo chemical process; it mainly depends on temperature which affects mostly the product yield and composition. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of temperature on the characterization of bio-oil liquid fraction derived from palm kernel shell (PKS) bio-oil. The temperatures were 100 °C and 140°C. The higher heating value (HHV) obtained were 28.6MJ/Kg and 31.5MJ/Kg for bio-oil fraction 100°C and 140°C respectively. The GC- MS analysis determined that phenol is the dominant product in bio-oil fractions. Nowadays, preservation of natural resources on earth is one of the most important concerns of humanity. In this regard, increasing the consumption of energy is one of the most critical challenges that humans are facing. Because, on the one hand, the untapped use of different sources of energy from fossil fuels can destroy this natural resource and, on the other hand, pollution from the use of these resources is a serious threat to the environment. Recent research suggests that affordable, sustainable and environmentally friendly fuels, which can be a good alternative to fossil fuels, have become more important. Therefore, biodiesel has made it possible to release less greenhouse gas emission and low toxicity emissions, which can partly meet fuel requirements and is the best alternative for petroleum diesel. In addition, the waste cooking oils are a major source of biodiesel for their essential compounds, such as glycerol. The use of waste cooking oils can reduce biodiesel production cost by 60 to 90 percent. Therefore, the main objective of this review is to study the production of biodiesel using transesterification reaction of waste cooking oil as an alternative fuel to petroleum diesel that can be used easily in diesel engines. This research has been carried out under the title of (Evaluation of teaching methods of chemistry concepts through laboratory work). The main objective of this research is to investigate learning and teaching methods, concepts that are taught by laboratory works and the challenges that may the teaching and learning methods face from the perspective of lecturers and students. In this research, to collect the statistical information a type of applications method and combined methods (related to library and region) has been used. In view of Cochran formula and Morgan table. The sampling method was selected systematically on random bases. In addition, the questionnaires were distributed to (136) students and (8) lecturers and their comments were collected. Based on the result of this study, researchers and lecturers have made it clear that the teaching methods of the concepts of chemistry by using laboratory works are directly related to various subjects in a complex concept, and students are taught by the activity of exploratory, exploration, problem-solving skills, and project centered. However, it can be possible in existence of sufficient materials and equipment. The majority of students and lecturers reminded the lack of laboratory, equipment and lack of knowledge of lecturers from active teaching methods of the laboratory. This study evaluates the relationship between Internet addiction and academic performance among students of eight Afghan universities. The differences between internet addiction in terms of gender was also identified. The survey/research method adopted the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) based on Young’s survey applied with some modifications. From 1000 distributed questionnaires only 976 participants (358 females, and 618 males) were responded completely. The descriptive analysis was used to identify the demographic characteristics of student’s Internet usage profile. The independents sample t-test was performed to determine the differences in the level of Internet addiction in terms of gender. Statistical significance was set at a value of p &lt;0.01. Likewise, the correlation test was implemented to identify the relationship between Internet addiction and academic performance, with referencing of sample. The results indicated that statistically there is a significant correlation among Internet addiction and academic performance. Results also indicated that statistically there were significant differences between Internet addictions in terms of demographic characteristics. This study suggests that future researchers need to work on large sample while conducting the related research. It emphasizes that students should concentrate more on their academic activities than spending time on unnecessary Internet surfing. Findings also revealed that, in Afghanistan the problem of Internet addiction is not a serious challenge, but this information should be disseminated among undergraduate university students to stop the indulgent in using the Internet. This research has been titled (Finding different learning methods of chemistry department students, education faculty of Jawzjan University). The overall aim of this study is to evaluate different styles of student’s learning in chemistry department and to find the most common used methods of learning as well. The importance of this study is the novelty of the topic which has not been investigated so far. This paper also focuses on the challenges and problems that students face in different ways of learning in chemistry department of education faculty. Both quantitative and qualitative methods have been used in this research and the questionnaire has been used for the data collection. In expressing the issue about the importance of learning, learning from the perspective of scientists, problems and challenges in lack of learning, the consequences of lack of learning by students in higher education institutes, schools, family, the individual and the entire community are discussed. In the theoretical part of this research, theories of behaviorism (Thorndike’s neural connection theory, contingent reflection theory, factor conditional theory), and cognitive theories (Gestalt theory, Bandura\\'s social learning, Davit-ausubel\\'s meaningful verbal discovery theory) has been used. In addition, in theoretical framework of this research, Thorndike\\'s neural communication theories, Bandura\\'s social learning, Bruner exploration learning, David-Ausubel\\'s verbal meaningful learning have been applied. The results of this study revealed that most of the students in chemistry department of education faculty at Jawzjan University are not aware of learning methods, while only 14.02% of students are familiar with the methods of learning. To achieve accurate results the hypothesis (students\\' learning methods are supposed to vary widely) are very clearly analyzed. The observation on relationship between some productive and reproductive traits of Jersey (J) x Red Sindhi (RS) cows. The data for the study were collected from 50 history sheets records maintained in the department of animal husbandry, Sam Higginbottom Institute–Deemed-to-be-Allahabad University, dairy farm Allahabad for the period from 1944 to 1960 Animals were managed by skilled persons under similar management condition. The mean of first second and third lactation length, lactation yield were 370.200 days, 474.320 days, 368.320 days, 1887.273 kg, 1975. 961 kg, and 1731.426 kg respectively. The mean of age at calving, first and second calving interval were 983.86 days, 436.44 days and 454.68 days respectively. There was high degree correlation between productive and reproductive traits. A total of 18 correlation coefficients were collected for determining the correlation between lactation length, lactation yield and age at calving, first and second calving interval. From 18 correlation, 10 values were found significant and 8 values were found non-significant.\n",
      "120 Evaluating is a useful activity in higher education institutions to make decisions and contribute to educational quality. The objective of the present investigation was to characterize the perception of university students towards the teaching competences for the tutorial action. With a non-experimental design, a cross-sectional study and with a descriptive scope, participated a non-probabilistic, intentional sample of 724 students from Instituto Tecnologico Superior del Oriente (ITESA) of Hidalgo State, who answered online a questionnaire of 20 items (Alfa= .97), with respect to seven competences: empathic attitude, commitment to the tutorial activity, capacity for the tutorial action, disposition to attend the students, ability to guide the students in academic decisions and satisfaction with the attention received. The results, in general, indicate that 85.5% of students perceive that the tutor competences are good to excellent, while 14.5% consider them as regular to bad, specifically in the empathic attitude competition the highest percentage was observed (55%) in the category of excellent (respect of the tutor towards the group) and the highest percentage in the category of bad (2.5%) was for the climate of trust that the tutor achieved. It is concluded that the tutorial teaching competences in ITESA are adequate but some areas of opportunity should be considered. Finally, it is affirmed that evaluation is an appropriate means to assess the processes in favor of integral education that some institutions currently offer According to The Activity Theory, the elderly who are involved and participate in more activities than the rest of this population reflect higher levels of satisfaction. These activities must be productive in concordance to the role that the older people assume within their context, in order to strengthen their well-being. Thus, this paper aims to describe the relationship between the frequency and satisfaction of the IADL, and the perception of Quality of life (QOL).&nbsp; Therefore, the design of this paper is non-experimental with a non-probabilistic purposive sample of 16 volunteer older adults who live in Hidalgo. The volunteers signed an informed consent form prior to the application of the Quality of Life questionnaire, older people version (WHOQOL-old) and a survey through an interview about their participation in different productive instrumental activities. The present findings show that the perception of QOL it is not fully determined by the frequency with older people perform those activities. It is concluded that, in older adults, is important both the frequency and satisfaction whit the instrumental activities, because of there are equally important, although participation in productive activities may have an incidence, it is necessary takes into accountant the value or the satisfaction experienced by the elderly during their perform because this influence their perception of well-being The healthy eating habits is a protective health factor while having inadequate eating habits increase different health problems in adults and particularly in children. Poor eating habits and the presence of psychological disorders, such as depression symptoms increase health risks. The main objective of this study was to determine the association among eating habits and symptoms of depression in a sample of Mexican children school, in a one-year follow-up study. With a non-experimental, longitudinal panel design, participated an intentional non-probabilistic sampling of 64 children (age range 8 to 10 years. The measurements were identified as evaluation 2016 and 2017. Participants answered in a one session the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Overeating Questionnaire (OQ) after the informed-consent of their parents. It was found a higher number of correlations in evaluation 2017 in comparison 2016 (rs; p &lt;.05) in both, boy and girls samples. Specifically, the evaluation 2016, highlights a strong association between body image and total CDI (rs = -.46; p &lt; .05) while in evaluation 2017, highlights a strong association between health habits and affective disturbance and total CDI (rs = .62; p &lt;.05). In conclusion, boy and girls, body image perception gets worse with the presence depressive symptoms, but over time, high affective alteration gets worse depressive symptoms.\\n&nbsp; Annually, 30,000 Mexicans are diagnosed with hematological diseases, of which about 18,000 must undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as the only opportunity to live and improve their quality of life. In this specialized medical procedure, psychosocial factors associated with biopsychosocial vulnerability, therapeutic adherence, final results of transplantation and survival interact, hence the importance of psychosocial evaluation. The objective of this article was to integrate and describe a psychological evaluation protocol aimed at the transplant candidate. From the search and free review of theoretical and applied articles in different bases, a brief evaluation guide was pointed out and it is concluded that its application facilitates the work of the psychologist in the context of hematological transplantation, favors the adaptation of the recipient, donor patient and his family and contributes to the improvement of the quality of life.\\n&nbsp; The aim of the study was to evaluate the dimensionality of the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support (SPOS) in Mexican population, in order to add evidence of construct validity of the results that are inferred from the instrument. The investigation was carried out in three phases. In the first Phase, participated 260 workers, with an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) two factors were identified, in which the main factor grouped Support items, and in the other factor items were found that theoretically can be classified as Perceived Organizational Betrayal. In the second Phase, participated 498 Mexican workers, through a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) a bifactorial theoretical measure of perceived Support-Betrayal was carried out. The adjustment of two measurement models was compared: the original one-dimension instrument, which presented no evidence of adjustment; while the two-dimensional measurement model did present an acceptable fit. In the third Phase, correlational analyzes were carried out with Organizational Commitment and Turnover Intentions that presented significant correlations. It is necessary to continue reviewing the original questionnaire under the complete theoretical model and continue to show evidence of the constructs that are to be measured, in order to have increasingly solid, valid, reliable and complete interpretations of the results of this approach of social exchange in the organizations This article is a theoretical review essay, which aims to present the events that are considered most relevant in the development and consolidation of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and which in turn have positioned it as a therapy of choice for Different psychological problems. A review was carried out with two of the most accessible digital search engines for undergraduate students, using search keywords according to the objective of this article. Identifying that cognitive-behavioral therapy is understood as the application of scientific psychology to clinical practice in a systematic and structured way. This model based on behavior modification because of its solid theoretical and experimental basis, which emphasizes the empirical verification of the techniques during its application. What makes CBT an effective, efficient, and timely clinical practice, improving the quality of life of users and positioning themselves in front of other psychological models in terms of efficacy. Musical processing has been described as a structural and functional plasticity model in which the areas involved and the connections are modified, these changes depend on several variables, including the start of training. The study of music as a neuropsychological phenomenon has become important because it provides information about the possible cognitive benefits. Objective: Describe and compare how musical practice Describe and compare how musical practice affects cognitive functioning in musicians who began their training at an early and late age.affects cognitive functioning in musicians who began their training at an early and late age. Method: Three groups were formed: A group of early professional musicians, a group of late-start professional musicians and a non-musicians control group. The NEUROPSI battery attention and memory were applied individually. Results: In a descriptive way, it was found that the performance profiles of the three groups behave differently and significant differences were found in memory, attention, executive functions and musical perception, especially among musicians who started before adolescence vs non-musicians. Conclutsions: Early musical practice has a favorable impact on tasks that involve attentional processes, executive functions and memory, although the practice can be beneficial throughout life. The development of well-being in the population becomes an important aspect for health due to the repercussions that can bring to their lives, currently obesity is a public health problem that is characterized by being chronic disease, caused by various factors ranging from genetic, metabolic or sociocultural problems, in this regard it has been mentioned that this imbalance with a negative trend between food intake and caloric expenditure, since, there is an increase in the first and a decrease in the second, which causes Adipose tissue accumulates and body weight is raised, it has been reported that the appearance of obesity in early stages of development (childhood / adolescence), increases the possibility of prolonging it until adulthood. In Mexico, the 2016 Health and Nutrition Survey indicates that for the adult population 20 years of age or older, a combined national prevalence of overweight and obesity of 71.2% in 2012 and 72.5%. What is relevant is that the comorbidity of obesity threatens the physical and mental health of the sufferer. Under this reasoning, the condition of obesity can be permeated by various aspects previously mentioned, such as physical discomfort, anxiety, sadness, feelings of guilt, frustration, reproaches towards himself or his environment, in this regard, it could be due to the ideal of beauty that prevails today - thinness - so when compared to this ideal causes biological, physical, psychological and social changes that threaten the quality of life. Due to this, the objective of the present investigation was to know the perception that workers and workers possess of the Sistema Estatal para el Desarrollo Integral de la Familia &nbsp;(SEDIF), with overweight and obesity, regarding their lifestyles and the presence of this disease in your life. The burnout syndrome has been recognized as a global public health problem by the WHO (ICD-11, 2018). Therefore, the aim of this research is to describe the characteristics and prevalence of burnout in Mexican employees and its relationship with sociodemographic, labor, and organizational variables. These research was carried out in two studies: in study 1, 476 workers participated, evidence of validity and reliability of the MBI-GS was found; In study 2, 1110 workers participated, descriptive and parametric analyzes were performed to find out the characteristics and prevalence of Burnout in the sample of participating workers. The results shown that 34.8% are in Danger of manifesting the syndrome and 15.9% are already Burned-out, this indicates that 50.7% of workers have a high probability of suffering damage to their health, both physical, mental and social. Groups identified with the highest percentage in Phase 4 \\\"Burned\\\" were Centennials (32.4%), Private Sector workers (18.1%) and Operating level workers (17.4%). One of the main points for successful child development is to achieve maturation of the Nervous System. However, growth can be affected by external factors linked to the family or school environment, which can cause behavioral, physical and socio-emotional disturbances to the development of the child, where social skills play a crucial role in preventing aggressive or violent behavior. The objective of this study was to determine the association between the orbitofrontal cortex and aggressive behavior in children from 11 to 13 years old, located in the city of Pachuca, Hidalgo. With a non-experimental design and a correlational scope, an intentional non-probability. A sample of 118 children participated. The participants were evaluated in two sessions, in the first with the Scale of Assertive Behavior for Children (CABS) and the second the Neuropsychological Battery of Executive Functions and Frontal Lobes (BANFE-2). A low and negative statistically significant correlation was found between aggressiveness and severe alteration in the orbitomedial cortex (r = -.273; p = &lt;. 01). They were also highlighting the relationship between aggressiveness and severe alteration in the orbitomedial zone in males (r = -.302; p = &lt;. 05).In conclusion, children who have a severe dysfunction in the orbitomedial cortex usually are more aggressive than those with an average or high score in this zone. Children born with a specific disability require primary caregivers who are\n",
      "121 The present paper investigates whether autonomous learning can improve their Islamic knowledge. The favorable characteristics of autonomous learning are used as the basis for (1) arguing against the assumption that Indonesian learners are dependent on their teachers and (2) arguing for its adoptions in improving student. The paper also discusses how to incorporate autonomous learning in competency based curriculum.Key Words: Autonous learning, competency based curriculum Philosophy and education are, them, but two stages of the some endeavor; philosophy to think out better values and idealism, education to realize these in life, in human personality. Philosophizing and education are, ten, but two stages of the some endeavor; The Islamic theory of education is fundamentally based upon the Qur’anic concepts. In this theory the door is left open for concepts which come from different fiels of knowledge propided thet they fit the Qur’anic perspective. All elements which be reconciled witch Islamic principles should be excluded..Philosophizing to think out better values and idealism, education to realize these in life, in human personality. The ultimate aim of muslim education lies in the realization of complete submission to Allah on the level of the individual, the community and humanity at large. In Islamic educational field, howewer, there are some prominent figurest who .have highly proposed educational theories in Islam. Baced on this fact, Islamic educational has two sourcesr for their educational process, and therefore, Islamic education must combined in balance they fungtion of school with the rule of society.Kata Kunci: Filsafat-Pendidikan Islam dan Epistimologi ilmu Education is the spearhead of a country. The more developed a country level will make the country more advanced. For that an educator should bias innovation in education. One of them by choosing teaching methods or create new methods appropriate to the learners so that the learning process can take place effectively and deliver results as expected. Teachers are required to have four competency in performing their duties. One of them is professional competence. For that, an educator must have the ability to keep abreast of the times. Today, the world is faced with rapid technological developments. Educators genius should be able to see it and take advantage of technology advances. However, the reality is the majority of educators can not develop their skills, especially regarding his duties as the subject of the learning process. Until finally learning activities becomes a difficult thing. This is evident from the number of educators both teachers and lecturers who use learning methods that are tedious (only one method such as a lecture).Keywords:educator, education, teaching methods and educational purposes. Pesantren Kombos was established in 1977. From the new order era to reformation, pesantren Kombos have contributed to socio-religious life in multicultural society in Manado (Islam 128.483 %, Christian 254.912 %, Catholic 20.602 %, Hindu 692 %, Buddha 2.224 %, and Konghucu 499 %). Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States and the Bali bombings in October 2002 in Indonesia, pesantren have been the focus of international attention. Foreigner called Islamic education as breeding grounds for terrorist. Acts of radicalism and terrorism (postnasionalism) commited by Abu Bakar Baa’syir and Abdullah Sungkar has made pesantren become training institutions of jihad against the West under Jamaah Islamiyah group as Sidney Jones’s observation. Other religions are taught from the perspective of a particular religion. This model of religious education has been challenged especially after the 1998 political reform. Through literature study, the result of this research indicates that the situation in Manado looks stable even not trapped in actions of radicalism and global terrorism. To respond postnasionalism, pesantren Kombos in Manado build three major movements, namely ideology-political movement, demographic-accomodative movement, and programmatic-assosiative movement. Those three movements are using humanist, rational, and functional approach. Thus, in summary, pesantren Kombos has a cosmopolitan character that is actualized in the system Torang Samua Basudara and Si Tou Timou Tumou Tou.Keywords : Movement, Pesantren Kombos, Postnasionalism Human association has had a long story which three institutions had struggled to dominate. The first is the family, which has blood and heredity for bases. The characteristic it engenders in humans are innate and immutable. Certainly, family-living engenders in humans other characteristics which are acquired through association. These, however, are not necessary. Members born to one family may successfully be brought up as members of another; but the innate characteristic remain unchanged. The family was declared by God an intrinsic order of creation. “O..Humankind, revere your Lord, Who created you of a single soul and created of it its spouse.. It is of God’s providing that He created of yourselves spouses in whom to find quiescene, and established between you love and compassion…that He generated from you and your spouses your children and grandchildren”. Parents, their children and grandchildren, and the love and compassion relation between them, constitute an immutable pattern of God creation. This is the family in its nuclear and extended forms spanning three generations. Islam not only acknowledges it but has girded it with law. Unlike any other social system, the law of Islam articulated the relations of all members of the extended family in order to insure proper functioning of all of them.

The method proposes to optimize the aggregate skeleton to achieve a lower rate of permanent deformations of the mixtures in service. This optimization is done considering the relation between gradation and voids changes in the mix properties. To that end Control sieves are defined, these allow a more accurate aggregate blend evaluation.\\nIn order to show how these considerations modify the dense asphalt mix properties a comparison was done between one conventionally designed mix and one designed with the Bailey method (in both cases the optimum binder content was determined by the Marshall method). These mixes were submitted to dynamic loads at 60 °C with the Wheel Tracking Test, evaluating rut resistance in each case.

Transport of solutes in streams are affected by multiple mechanisms and processes that include river morphology, turbulence, reaireation, and transient storage areas which include re-circulation zones, hyporheic flows and dead zones. The hyporheic zone is an active ecotone between the surface stream and groundwater. In this zone important exchanges of water, nutrients, and organic matter occur in response tovariations in discharge and bed topography and porosity. Is in this zone where water that is ﬂowing in the stream channel ﬂows into the subsurface materials of the streambed and then returns to the main stream, making the hyporheic zone a continuous link between the stream’s channel and catchment. The dead zone is defined as a region of static or slowly moving water (i.e. backwater eddies, stagnant water at the bottom of pools, and flow through vegetation). Dead and hyporheic zones play a key role in controlling the water quality, for instance affecting the stream dissolved oxygen concentration, which ultimately controls the habitat suitability for a number of aquatic and riparian species. To evaluate the influence, effects and importance of hyporheic zone in the transport of solutes a field camping was conducted, where a series of Rhodamine injections were monitored in along a 271 m reach in Bear Valley Creek, ID, USA. The analysis of the dead zones and hyporheic flows was performed using the OTIS Model (One-Dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage, USGS) where the governing equation underlying the model is the advection- dispersionequation with additional terms to account for transient storage, and first-order decay. Results showed that the includingtransient storage areas, in this casehyporheic and dead zones must be explicitly included in order to describe how solutes are transported in a stream whose bed present some degree of permeability.

Currently, it is evident the need to have materials with better specifications, which guarantee a long useful life of the structures. In the last 10 years, nano-structured materials have been involved to improve the properties of asphalt mixtures and cementitious matrices, since the carbon nanotubes (NTC) allow to obtain an integral increase of the properties of the pavements surpassing any type of modifier previously studied. Although the first world countries dominate the market, in Colombia the production of these nano-materials is emerging. Therefore, this paper studies the possible domestic production of large amounts of NTC needed to modify building materials and infrastructure. This work serves as input for a feasibility and construction of a future NTC production plant; That is, it determines whether it is possible to produce at lower costs than those proposed by the world market.

The phenomenon of water column separation (WCS) and subsequent air cavity collapse (ACC) can significantly increase the maximum pressure, with risk to damage or destroy the pipelines. In this paper, the equations governing this phenomenon by applying the analysis based on the Discrete Vapor-Cavity Model (DVCM) according to theMethod of the Characteristics applied on a real pumping system discretized according to the specified time interval are shown. WCS and ACC effects are analyzed when the transient flow is generated by the pumps shutdown located in the system’s upstream end. A sensitivity analysis on the main parameters affecting the DVCM model, with special emphasis on the effect of the number of pipe reaches chosen in the discretization and the air cavity length, is performed. It is concluded that the results depend on theinitial parameters and the way how the network is discretized.

In the modelling of water distribution systems is common to assume that water demands are located at the junctions, with a constant and previously known value. This assumption allows simplify the mathematical analysis of the problem, even when in some cases is more suitable to model the water demand assuming that it has a magnitude which is pressure-sensitive. In this article an original pressure-sensitive approach is proposed to calculate the state variables (flow and pressure) in a pipe with uniformly distributed demands. The general conclusion is that the approach based on the pressure-sensitive demand, compared with the usual method of the pressure-insensitive demand, shows significant attenuation in pressure which may condition the design and/or operating procedure of some devices such as valves or air chambers.&nbsp;\n",
      "123 This study aims to determine the feasibility of implementing an inductive approach in teaching speaking skills. The qualitative descriptive was used in this study by using content analysis technique. The technique of obtaining data used documentation. The data were analyzed by coding, display, and verification. The data analysis was carried out in depth by using some theories related to the inductive approach in teaching speaking skills. The results of the study indicate the interrelated of the implementation and responses of the students in using this approach. The results show that the inductive approach is very helpful for students in learning to speak English because it is based on the examples given and they have learnt to find patterns in English speaking. By seeing the examples, they also learn how to imitate the way how people say in English and they are actively involved in the teaching and learning process. Furthermore, it is suggested that inductive approach can be used in speaking class. The development of learning media that is interesting and relevant to the education system in Indonesia, although the ability of learners is a barrier today. Various development efforts are always done to complement the process of material oblivion that has been given. Learning methods and learning media are two things that cannot be ignored. Having English skills will add value in the context of human resources. But in an academic environment, English is a foreign language that needs to be mastered not only in communication but also regarding technology and science. The increasingly rapid technological development takes part in the learning development system. Many learning media are used to improve the ability of information or science. Furthermore, this study uses a learning management system (LMS) as one of the technology media to improve students’ vocabulary. The study focuses on the effort to improve vocabulary mastery by using a learning management system. The subjects of this study were the second-semester students from informatics department, Universitas Kanjuruhan Malang. The results of this study show that the students are easier to understand the vocabulary used in technology informatics fields. It can be seen that the results of their average of the final score are 85.00 improved higher than the previous score, before the use of LMS in the teaching vocabulary, the score is 65.00. It is expected that the result of this study can be one of the alternative ways to help students understand vocabulary easily. The inclusion of literature for language teaching is not something new. Nowadays, the use of literature is becoming quite common for teaching language skills. The purpose of this study is to develop an instructional material by using literature-based instruction for essay writing course in University of PGRI Wiranegara, Pasuruan. The research used Gall, Borg, &amp; Gall research and development procedure with some adaptations. The instruments used in the study were questionaires, interview, and tests. The instructional material was tried out and tested to students who joined essay writing class in the academic year 2018-2019. The students’ essays were analyzed by using Jacobs ESL Composition profile covering five elements, namely content, organization, vocabulary, language and mechanics. The result of the study shows that the instructional material was proven to be adequately successful to be used for essay wrting course. The use of literature for teaching writing gives benefits for the students, not only in terms of their writing skills, but also sharpen their critical thinking ability. One reason for the low ability to write observational reports is the method that is often used by teachers in learning Indonesian is only limited to lecture methods, and group work. So the perception that Indonesian is a boring subject because of the lack of learning media used by teachers. This can result in students being less able to work on the results of observational reports. One effort to overcome this is to use an innovative learning model that is the Project based learning model. The purpose of this study, among others, is to determine the effect of project based learning learning models on the skills of writing observational report texts in class X students of Parlaungan Islamic High School in Sidoarjo. The population in this study were grade X students of Parlaungan Waru Sidoarjo Islamic High School as many as 44 students. A total of 22 students as the Experiment class who used the project based learning model and 22 students as the control class who used the direct learning model. After analyzing SPSS 16 using an independent sample test, the probability value = 0.001 &lt; significance level = 5% means that there is an influence of PBL learning models on the skills of writing observational reports The purpose of this study is to know whether there is a significant correlation between students’ grammar mastery and their ability in writing. This research was conducted using quantitative method by using correlational research design. The target population of this research was all fourth semester students of English Education Study Program at Teachers Training and Education (STKIP) PGRI Pasuruan in academic year 2017/2018. The researcher used test and scoring guide as the instruments of this study. In collecting the data, the researcher conducted the writing test and the grammar test. The finding shows that there is no correlation between students’ writing ability and their grammar mastery for the fourth semester students of English Education Study Program at STKIP PGRI Pasuruan in academic year 2017/2018. The null hypothesis is not rejected because the significant value is 0.876 ≥ 0.05. This paper examined students’ proficiency in analyzing derivational affixes in English. The objective of this research was to discover how far the students’ capability in analyzing errors of prefixes and suffixes in English sentences. The researchers limited this study to focus only on derivational affixes. In order to obtain the data, students were tested. The participants of this research were undergraduate students of the English education department at STKIP Pamane Talino, West Kalimantan. The researchers used a descriptive qualitative method to analyze the data. The results showed the average of students’ proficiency in analyzing prefixes and suffixes in sentences was 68.57%. More specifically, seven students (33.33%) belonged to the “excellent” category, seven students (33.33%) belonged to the “very good” category, four students (19.04%) were categorized as a “good” category, two students (9.52%) were classified as a “fair” category, and one student (4.76%) belonged to the “poor” category. The pandemic of COVID 19 has caused a drastic change in the way the students’ learn. Instead of learning at school, the students learn from home. This paper is aimed at describing the students’ and parents’ opinion, reasons, and difficulties during the learning from home. The researcher used a mixed method design to collect the data. The subjects of the study were 25 students in grade 9 of SMP A Wahid Hasyim Pasuruan and 28 parents. The instruments were open and close questionnaire and interview. The data is collected from October to December 2020. The result shows that 1) the students and the parents agreed that online learning was effective for the teaching and learning process during the pandemic of COVID 19. 2) The students like online learning because online learning saves time (41.66%). On the other hand, the parents prefer online learning because of health reasons, which is to avoid the spread of covid-19. The major problem faced by the students and parents is the internet quota. The result shows that most students and parents agree that online learning becomes the most preferable way to conduct the teaching and learning process during the pandemic of COVID 19. This study aims to identify the use of regional languages in student reading books published by the Ministry of Education and Culture. This type of research is a qualitative descriptive study.

      "124 There have been many writings and discussions that dealt with the details and interpretation of the research methods and the identification of the methods and methodological methods used by researchers and writers as they deal with research topics and problems in all fields of natural and human sciences. But we noticed that the movement of science and its knowledge and development requires the identification of suitable tools and methodological methods appropriate for each type of science. In other words, attempts should be established to build appropriate methodological tools for human and cognitive activity that can be referred to as a specific science that sets out certain paths of the human sciences which is certainly the origin of all the systematic and research construction of human, social and historical knowledge, etc. Due to the expansion of the media’ activity and its importance and development in different life and overlapping with the branches of social and human sciences in general, it is necessary to identify and sort special tools employing them with this human and technical activity. &nbsp;Thus, that the methodological tools used in media studies with their impact and effect and audience are appropriate for the development of information gathering and measuring quantitatively and qualitatively. So we can subject a topic to be analyzed or surveyed by means of quantitative mathematical tools and indices so that we can describe and determine their factors and its main and subsidiary variables accurately. By turn, we confirm that the process of depicted description needs to set of relations and statistical links that should be available to reflect the hypotheses or queries of the research. What we will find in this research are scientific attempts to find scientific methods and tools aiming to establish special scientific approaches media phenomena for and its surrounding interferences and dynamic interact. In spite of the contemporary development over the world in pertaining of modernization and its differences about the transformation of the knowledge but, the important instrument to transfer the thoughts and information did not have change except the language. So the evolutionary process became as a torrent or fusillade above the cliff which drifted anything.&nbsp;So that the objective inquiry and impressed with varieties of development the casement to evaluate the linguistic or re - correction highlight article in order to preserve on the origins of the language and its sobriety.Today, we have different correspondence and social media as Email, Website, an another of connection on the Internet, which resembled among the various societies. Furthermore, it had been given up the form of assessment within its linguistic origins that need accuracy and precise&nbsp;in right Arabic words.Finally, the process of research in exploring the gravity of language to address the specialization and the responsibility of spread an important language and means of maintaining all knowledge fields in language. The modernity of election practices of the elections in Iraq, according to the democratic approach, has led to a struggle between political rival forces reflecting a deep pressure on the tools involved in the management, marketing or control of these elections across the general social level. Hence the problem of research resides in answering the following question: What is the nature and size of the pressures affecting the media performance of Al-Iraqia News channel before the legislative elections of 2018 in Iraq?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives of the research were the following:1. to identify the nature of the pressures that limit the Al-Iraqia News channel’s performance of its functions objectively before the legislative elections determining&nbsp;&nbsp;its sources;2. to know the magnitude of the impact represented by those pressures among the employees of media in the designated channel despite their belief of the availability of guarantees in the case of failure to respond to such pressures ;3. &nbsp;to analyze the role of higher and direct administrations to challenge such pressures or Submission&nbsp;&nbsp;for them; and&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To characterize of the reality of the Al-Iraqia News channel’s media performance before the legislative elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research community, represented by media professionals in Al-Iraqia News channel, included department directors, heads, secretaries of editors, editors, correspondents, translators, program providers and news bulletin newscasters. The sample (50) was chosen out of the total number of employees -98. (44) completed forms were adopted while (6) forms were excluded for non-fulfillment of the conditions of the research. The statistical processing covered the total (44) completed forms. The research ended with a set of results related to sources and natures of pressures which Al-Iraqia News channel›s employees and professionals faced during the course of their media work The research is based on an important subject according to the researchers\\' estimations. It is the disclosure of the nature of the relationship between Watching to cultural programs in satellite channels and the book\\'s vision of the intellectual, and the pursuit of purchasing and acquiring it It is a scientific addition to the scientific research media because it deals in the field of new about the nature of the relationship between satellite programs and writers, and it provides a scientific development on the importance of satellite channels in the promotion of the book and sales of intellectual elite. The study examined the audience of the recipients of literature for cultural programs, the nature of the public, characteristics, social status and educational level And the extent of follow-up to cultural programs, and the reasons for follow-up or lack of follow-up, and the best viewing times and what subjects are interested and preferred, and whether these characteristics affected the market books and sales and other questions that can give us a picture of this relationship. The majority of the sample who are keen to follow cultural programs are writers and writers. The reasons for non-follow-up of cultural programs and cultural pages in the newspapers have been shown by the rest of the sample researchers because of the lack of seriousness of programs and pages and the lack of preparation. Scientific and electronic books download in all fields. &nbsp;\\n\\nThe media, especially the satellite channels in our time, are one of the most important pillars of daily life, public and private, for society and people, and are considered by sociologists and sociologists as one of the most important factors of social upbringing and the most important, as a result of the technological and technological development of the media as well as increasing their numbers and vertical and horizontal expansion locally, As well as entering into the lives of individuals and people and leading them to important sites within their interests and preferences, not to mention the long time spent exposure to those media and benefit from the programs offered or broadcast. , The problem of this research is that there is a lack or weakness or ambiguity in understanding the relationship between the exposure of the public to the news channels and the levels of preference and evaluation of programs broadcast by these channels and employees of the public achieved as a result of exposure. According to the above, the problem of research in is to answer the following questions: a.

The official spokesperson considered responsible for the transmission of information and communication messages that convey the government’s view on the various political and economic issues that affect the public opinion towards the performance achieved by the various governmental institutions and for the purpose of communicating with the media in a positive and effective manner, a number of institutions in the world in general and in Iraq in particular have nominated a spokesman to coordinate the efforts and the dissemination of news and the preparation of press conferences to contribute to the achievement of a positive and effective level between the government and the media, so this study has tackled to deal with the credibility of the government official spokesman to the public as an important factor reflected on the nature of the public reception and the image of his media and professional performance, especially during crisis, through questionnaire distributed in Baghdad and Sulaymaniyah on (181) individuals and the study has reached a number of results:1. The task of the media spokesperson to invite the media to clarify the government position regarding its relations with the neighboring countries has come the first rank and with an average of (3.6).2. The official spokesperson of the Iraqi government has a high level of credibility among the public. The high level of credibility of the official spokesman was achieved at 100 frequency and a percentage of 5 The research topic is summarized in the importance of studying the measuring the extent of the university youth’s exposure in the Emirati Society to those series and the resulting achieved satisfaction. The most important results and recommendations of the study are as follows: a high rate of the respondents’, sample individuals, exposure to the dubbed Turkish series since it is evident that almost three-fourths of the study individuals watch the dubbed Turkish series,.”. The most significant positive aspects of the dubbed Turkish series are: “they focus on the most important tourist attractions in Turkey” and “ improving the audience›s knowledge and information on the traditions of the Turkish society”. The most apparent negatives of the dubbed Turkish series are: “they discuss topics that do not agree with the local traditions”, “they promote strange ideas that are incompatible with the society” , “they attract teenagers through inappropriate models and ideas”, “they promote ideas and opinions that are incompatible with the Islamic values” and “they destroy the national identity”.. The study recommends conducting more researches on the impact of the dubbed Turkish series shown on the different satellite channels on the different sectors of the audience as well as conducting detailed studies on the nature of preparing the contents of those series and carrying out studies on the audience of the specialized channels and their attitudes towards them. They call upon setting special policies of media for presenting those\n",
      "125 What I seek to propose in this article is, on the one hand, a brief summary about the issue of theatricality in the Divine Comedy; on the other hand, I seek to analyze this phenomenon in greater detail in one of the most dramatical episodes of Inferno, that of the thieves’ metamorphoses. The discourse on theatrical dimension remains in this article in relation to other discourses (philosophical, theological), consistent with the intentio auctoris. Referring on Aristotelian hylomorphism, I consider the metamorphic contrapasso of the damned as a sad consequence of the damage caused by mortal sin to their virtus informativa. This “lectura Dantis” starts from one of Sandro Botticelli’s famous drawings for Comedy, preserved at the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, i.e. from the drawing that the artist made for the twenty-eighth Canto of Purgatory around 1488-1492 (or so). This canto offers a variety of reasons that exemplarily underscore the relations between Dante’s poetic conception and Botticelli’s artistic one. Botticelli’s deep interest for Dante, and more precisely for the Eden described by the poet, clearly emerges also in the famous Spring, a painting that represents the ambience of Dante’s Eden in an exemplary way.

This canto offers a variety of reasons that exemplarily underscore the relations between Dante’s poetic conception and Botticelli’s artistic one. Botticelli’s deep interest for Dante, and more precisely for the Eden described by the poet, clearly emerges also in the famous Spring, a painting that represents the ambience of Dante’s Eden in an exemplary way. For their film version of the first eight cantos from Dante`s Inferno, A TV Dante – Cantos I-VIII (1989), Peter Greenaway and Tom Phillips developed a completely new and highly innovative adaptation strategy: Based on an earlier illustration cycle and translation of Dante’s Inferno by Tom Phillips, Greenaway and Phillips conceived A TV Dante as a ›new edition‹ of the artist book. For this, they transferred typical book structures in the film and, similar to Phillips’ own symbolical illustration strategy, ›translated‹ the text of the Inferno in a ›symbolical TV language‹. In this article, I will give an overview over the central adaptation principles in A TV Dante. The aim of the paper is to propose a first path through the rereading of the Vita Nuova within the Pre-Raphaelite culture, examining the refined edition of the Vita Nuova illustrata dai quadri di Dante Gabriel Rossetti, published by Roux and Viarengo in early \\'900. This posthumous edition is not the result of a specific illustrative authorial project, although the poet-painter had aimed for this since his early age; it is rather an a posteriori and partly arbitrary collection, which puts together the reproductions of some Rossetti\\'s illustrations from Dante\\'s pamphlet. The artist never stopped working on these subjects, translating at the same time Dante\\'s Vita Nuova and other Early Italian Poets, while working on his own poetic and literary production (The Blessed Damozel and Hand and Soul, at least): this demonstrates a deep repossession of the text, which is characterized by a certain literal accuracy, but also by a deep revision, according to a completely different historical and artistic context. This essay challenges the traditional critical interpretation of the Coen Brothers’ 2001 film “O Brother Where Art Thou” by proposing that the film is not simply a retelling of the Odyssey but rather that it looks not to the Homeric narrative but rather to Dante’s reinvention of the Greek hero Odysseus / Ulysses for its inspiration. In support of this argument the essay highlights a number of narrative cues that point us to Inferno 26, where Ulysses is punished as a fraudulent counselor. The fact that the film’s protagonist, Ulysses Everett McGill was convicted of impersonating a lawyer and lied to his “brothers” Delmar and Pete to induce them to escape with him, are but two such indicators examined in this study. But the essay also looks at the role that the soundtrack plays in alerting the reader to a highly Dantesque hermeneutic strategy, as well as the film’s Dantesque awareness of the role of ingegno in creating fiction, or lies that look like truth. These pages aim to explore the big fortune of the forgotten film Dante’s Inferno directed in 1924 by Henry Otto, and to underline how it is influenced on one side by the peculiar dantism of Ralph Waldo Emerson and on the other by the populist sentimentalism of Dickens’ novel A Christmas Carol. Abstract This paper examines a hardly studied case of the reception of Dante in Argentine literature. In 1916 Leopoldo Lugones published a long essay entitled El payador (Argentine Spanish for “troubadour”) the aim of which was to provide a historical and philosophical rationale for the existence of an Argentine race—understood in a nineteenth-century positivistic way as the ontological bearer of the nation—that was seen as the final result of the European civilization. According to Lugones, during the Conquista the civilization began a slow migration from Europe to America that ended in the creation of a new race which prototype was the Argentine “gaucho”. From the standpoint of Lugones’ theory of the translatio of a civilization (where both power (imperium) and culture (studium) migrate), the “gauchos” belonged to a series that went from Homer to Dante, and from Dante to José Hernández, the author of Martín Fierro. This paper studies the way in which Lugones reads Dante within the historiographical frame of the theory of an Argentine translatio. Keywords: Leopoldo Lugones; Dante; translatio imperii et studii; Argentine literature; Argentine philosophy. In the context of Christian penitence, medieval preachers, confessors, and philosophers aligned dancing with lust, pride, and sacrilege. These negative attitudes toward dance colored medieval depictions of Purgatory and damnation. However, Dante’s Purgatorio offers a very different representation of purgatorial bodies. This article shows how dance in the Purgatorio is not associated with punishment, but rather moral discipline, self-transformation, and spiritual redemption. In conclusion, I address some of the deeper implications that Dantesque dancing may have on critical theory and performance today. The present article seeks to dig into Gustave Doré’s (1832-1883) vision of the Wood of the Suicides from his illustrations of the Divine Comedy (d. 1861), establishing a comparison between its critical reception, the works that have illustrated the chant over the centuries and Doré’s works themselves. A goal here is to glimpse if negative criticism had any basis beyond the prejudices of that period and, at the same time, to showcase the Romantic vision that transformed the chant into something completely new in the XIXth century. The sources prove how Doré, far from what critics intended to see in his works, approached Dante Alighieri’s capolavoro with a neither correct or incorrect vision, but a vision that is a part of his own time and sensitivity, with several inescapable connections with his contemporary aesthetic views and theories. Between 1949 and 2016, almost twenty comic book adaptations of Dante’s Inferno were created worldwide. The following analyses focus on the updates the comics contain in addition to the fact that the medium itself has only existed for little more than a hundred years. Furthermore, the functions of the updates will be examined.\n",
      "126 Painting in its development has undergone various criticisms both of the medium and its conceptual substance. Currently painting is widely regarded as mere representation strategy. This study tries to see and tracing the paradigm shift in the era of contemporary painting, conceptual expansion, particularly the use of optical devices in its creation. Case study in this research is an exhibition in 2007 entitled Errata-Optika that was believed to be an important milestone paradigm shift in contemporary painting. This study used qualitative methods to approach the criticism and the study ofliterature on the history of painting to contemporary era. Observation was carried out as a method of collecting data from the exhibition Errata-Optika. The exhibition featured seven artists and twenty-two paintings that used optical devices in its creation method.Keywords: Post-conceptual Painting, Contemporary Art, Bandung, Exhibition Cirebon Batik Pegajahan is the result ofthe creative process, feeling, intention, also long thought of people who have expertise in interpreting the condition of people‘s behavior of Cirebon (palace), which was then adapted into a form of art and culture of batik fabric through a process of creativity of the craftsmen. This Batik Pegajahan grows and develops within the community of (palace) Cirebon, including: Kasepuhan Palace, Kanoman, Kacirebonan, and Keprabonan.This study will explain the symbolic narrative contained in Pegajahan Cirebon batik decoration. The discussion is based on the systematic symbolic visual elements of the Pegajahan batik decoration which is based on the teachings ofthe Tarekat Syattariyah attitudes and behavior of (palace) Cirebon society, form of local wisdom that is reﬂected in the symbolic-aesthetic elements.The research used descriptive—analytic method and ethnography, in describing the symbolic narrative found in Batik Pegajahan Cirebon, The results are in the form ofvisual data complete with symbolic narratives in Batik Pegajahan Cirebon, which represents behavior of (palace) Cirebon people significantly; so it can be used as reference for further research in the reconstruction, reproducing, and formulating such ornaments as the basis for designing or guidance for the people of batik (palace) Cirebon in particular.Keywords: Symbolic Narratives, Decoration of Batik Pegajahan and Tarekat Syattariyah This study aims to implement a strategy of preservation and development of Gorontalo’s local culture through a web based application that can store and display the digitizing results of Gorontalo’s local culture called “Gorontalo cultural digital repository\\\".

This research is aimed at identifying the Sasak ethnic art, Balinese ethnic and art acculturation in Mataram. Results ofsubsequent identification is packaged in a DVD for the Performing Arts with the theme of strands of Gumi Sasak pearls. The story in the DVD is wrapped with the story of Dewi Rengganis that will bring the potential of art and ethnicity in Mataram so that it can become a World tourist destinationThe results showed that people\\'s lives of Mataram city are quite harmonious eventhough composed of various ethnic groups such as Sasak as indigenous people, Balinese, Javanese, Malay and so forth that they are migrant population. Harmony is evident from the understanding of the city pluralism, then practiced in the tolerance life that create a harmonious life that becomes public capital to develop themselves. This harmonious situation is so interesting that it is realized in a collaborative art with the theme of strands of Gumi Sasak pearls that tells about the diversity of art and culture in the city of Mataram that lives in harmony. This story is wrapped in the story of Dewi Rengganis that becomes an original story of Sasak tribe. The result ofthis collaborative art is expected to be one ofthe selling points and at once an alternative tourism product that could help realize Mataram city to be one of the World‘s tourist destinations.Keywords: pluralism of arts, tourism potential, Mataram City As a creative activity, art cannot be merely understood as an individual expression, but a social stage, in which common aesthetic experiences are socially built. Being a social product, art is a medium of various socio-political interests, particularly the interests of a particular community or institution. By employing a participatory research method, this paper is aimed at understanding of how art is used by a particular state’s institution for two interrelated functions. Internally, art is used to create social cohesion and commonality, to enhance work‘s productivity and creativity in the institution. Externally, art is practiced as form of cultural diplomacy, to promote national political, economical and cultural interests in the context of international relation. The conclusion of the research is that the functions of art in the context of state‘s institution are as a form of esthetic experience, institutional and community building, cultural exchange and cultural diplomacy.Keywords: Art, Aesthetic, Institution, Cultural Diplomacy, National Security and Safety. Stories about gamelan used in warfare are regarded as a character in a fairy tale, a story ofthe past apocryphal. The slogan of history that says no document no historical is an expression that history should not be based solely on “people said\\\" or a story that is not necessarily true, he should be based on the facts of historical events occurred, so that the necessary documents to uncover the historical events. A historical narrative method is needed in the process of developing the method known as historical methods. The ancient manuscripts as a source of literary history, many stores historical events related to culture, especially with the musical arts. In this article will be discussed is the word Bheri and Mrdangga of two ancient manuscripts that ofwhich have been translated into Indonesian by previous researchers.Keyword: gamelan, war gamelan, story, mredangga, bheri The research on \\\"The Effect of the addition of sawdust on the physical properties of ceramic body of Kidul clay-based Earthenware \\\" has been performed with different percentages. The sawdust used is wood shavings waste ofbuilding materials. Based on the results ofehemical analysis, sawdust is known to have a tendency as a fuser, whereas Kidul clay contain enough clay substance / loam, feldspar and quartz minerals. This study aims to determine the physical properties of the composite body period, either in a state of pre-combustion and post-combustion as ceramics earthenware. The produced ceramic objects can be used as a container of crop water by permeation techniques. So what is sought is a composition with a value permeation / absorption ofwater / the greatest PA. To observe its physical properties, measures of laboratory scale study was conducted by testing the bricks and the scale of production through prototype test. The result is in accordance with the purpose that is the body mass of BG1 code that has been qualiﬁed as Earthenware ceramics at a fuel temperature of l.l50oC with a value PA = 20.2% (SNI: 7275-2008, PA&gt; 15% categorized as soft delicate earthenware or mayolika, while SII: 0803-83, PA&gt; 20% is categorized as smooth soft earthenware with fuel temperature ofl000oC). However, further research still needs to be done with the addition ofan adjuvant sawdust with varied percentages in addition to testing with various forms ofdesign in order that in terms of aestheties and function the earthenware ceramic objects later become more meaningful.Key words: Kidul clay, sawdust, earthenware, water absorption, shrinkage amount This article is a summary of the result of research to review aspects of the art, mystical stories and religiousity ofBarong and Rangda in Mamintar ceremony at Indigenous Village of Serangan. To reveal these aspects deeply, a qualitative approach is used with an ethnographic design through active participation observation, interview and documentation method. Based on this methodology, the research explained that ﬁrst, Barong and Rangda for Serangan people has an arts aspect but religious. This religious art is needed to bind a sense of devotion to God. Second, aspects of religious art in the Barong and Rangda were born from a long process of sanctification, including the magical power that is built through various myths and mystical stories. Third, Barong and Rangda is the meeting of two different strengths into one or monodualistic of a samyoga to generate new energy. Mamintar ceremony is samyoga of monodualistic Barong and Rangda with the energy produced to neutralize the negative influences that come from the sea. Fourth, the presence of Barong and Rangda in Mamintar ceremony becomes legitimator to the reinforcement of social solidarity of the society that are under the threat, especially from the outside through a giantic project of beach reclamation, strengthening selfidentity as an island communities who still love the sea, and means of culture to be in harmony with the universe.Keywords: Religious-Art, Mystical Stories, Religiosity, Barong, Rangda, Mamintar Ceremony. The Fashion Carnaval, which is a phenomenon in district city of Jember, has been held every July to August since 2003. The existence ofthis event has a positive impact for the peopleliving in Jember. It does not only encourage the creativity of young people, but also improves the social life, economy, culture, politics and tourism of Jember.Jember Fashion Carnaval is in the process of becoming an iconic event of Jember, We knew this event from cross-border communication, mass media and its routine roadshow in the country and abroad, as well as its achievements in various international beauty contests, The successful Jember Fashion Carnaval (JFC) has made the city of Jember more internationally recognized and this has a positive impact on other cities in Indonesia in a way that this motivates those cities to create something interesting about them. The other regions are motivated to discover their local potency and make it in such a way that it can become a similar successful fashion carnaval. Indonesian people have been familiar with such art festival that is held on the streets and a part of ritual. This kind of activity has been a strongly rooted tradition since many years ago until now.Changing an art event into a contemporary performing art in the form ofa fashion carnaval is not something contrary to the culture of Indonesian society. Both have visual similarity and use the streets as their venues. Their purpose is the only difference. The Jember Fashion Carnaval, that has successfully become the icon of the city, has encouraged what is known as Wonderful Archipelago, a carnaval culture diaspora phenomenon, which is easily absorbed, spread and becomes fruitful across the countryKey Words: Culture Diaspora, Jember Fashion Carnaval, Wonderful Archipelago The specific objective to be achieved in this research is to identify the characteristics of packaging design that is used to package a culinary ayam betutu in the city of Denpasar.

      "127 The process of soil improvement with this technique was developed by choosing a site where fine soils are present, to proceed with a geotechnical exploration and characterization, determining the physical and mechanical properties of the study soil. With the results obtained, the next step corresponds to the adaptation of the injection equipment to start the consolidation injections. The injections were made in the same holes of the exploration with a water-cement slurry, determining a range of pressures. After the injections were made, a new exploration was made to determine, by comparing the parameters, the change in the physical and mechanical properties of the soil and thus observe the usefulness of the improvement process. Initially, representative samples of mineral fines, binders and coals, the reason for the study, were taken to characterize them. At the same time, the pelletizing disk of the laboratories of the UPTC School of Metallurgy was developed. Then we proceeded to make mixtures of mineral fines, coal and binder, in order to find the ideal proportions to obtain high-performance pellets, taking into account the kinetic and thermodynamic conditions of the process. The experimental design determined that the number of tests to be performed is 48, that is, 3 repetitions for each sample. Then, tests were carried out to study the reducibility of the pellets, evaluating the behavior of these with each of the binders once the reduction temperature had been reached. The pre-reduced obtained was analyzed by chemical and microscopic methods. The loads imposed by the traffic on the elastic flexible pavement structures generate the so-called deflection basins, which affect the structural and functional operation of a flexible pavement structure and, therefore, its useful life. The purpose of this work is to show the effect of the maximum load of the tractor-type truck-trailer C3S3- on the deflection of a flexible pavement structure and to model its corresponding deflection bowl in a three-dimensional system. The deflection analysis is made taking into account a flexible reference pavement structure, consisting of an asphalt tread layer, a granular base layer and a granular sub-base layer, supporting the entire structural package on the subgrade. The SHELL BISAR 3.0 program was used to model the deflection basins, which allows calculating the stresses, deformations and deflections at any point in the structure of the flexible pavement structural model. Finally, some recommendations are presented that must be taken into account in the structural and functional design of a pavement structure.This article is part of the research on the behavior of deflection based on the design parameters of a pavement structure, which the author has been advancing at the School of Transport and Roads, Faculty of Engineering of the Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia , in the Research and Development Group on Road Infrastructure -GRINFRAVIAL-. A magnetoreological fluid (MR) is an oily liquid that exhibits a density approximately three times greater than that of water. This fluid can be changed from an oily to a quasi-solid state in fractions of a second, when it is exposed to a magnetic field density. This article presents the results of a comparative study carried out on two test mixtures, composed of two different types of automotive oil, for which the concentration levels and the type of metallic particles in suspension were varied. After executing a scientific procedure based on an experimental factorial design, significant changes in the viscosity of the fluid were observed when varying the density of the magnetic field for each mixture. This allows to conclude that, for the experienced fluids, the process of component characterization and optimization for the mixing relationships is feasible in observance of mechanical and civil applications. The purpose of this article is to present a meaning for the formation of the Systems Engineering Program of the Autonomous University of Bucaramanga, from its Institutional Educational Project and from the origins and foundations of systems engineering. Based on this presentation, some general competencies of the program are proposed. The article offers this reflection exercise as a way to rethink training in systems engineering, from the intention of respecting the context from which this interdisciplinary engineering intervention is carried out. The main objective of the investigation was to determine in the Tunja-La Playa road corridor the areas susceptible to mass removal phenomena, caused by seismic-type events, and to perform the liquefaction analysis for the deposits present. After processing the information, it was determined that the corridor presents very specific sectors where the susceptibility to mass removal phenomena is high, mainly affected by topography and soil type. Likewise, in the liquefaction analysis it was determined that there is a high susceptibility in the fluviolacustres deposits in the north of the city of Tunja, which are attenuated by the great distance between these sites and the analyzed synogenic sources. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n990/5000\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe sensitivity analysis of each of the variables that influence the design of a rigid pavement structure is presented, from the point of view of pavement mechanics, and the incidence of these on the deflection of the structural model. The variables analyzed were the following: the applied load, the thickness of the slab, the load radius, the modulus of elasticity of the concrete, the Poisson\\'s ratio of the concrete and the reaction module of the support or foundation assembly of the slab. Through the sensitivity analysis it is possible to define the most sensitive variables or those that affect to a greater or lesser degree the deflection of the structure, and thus be able to have tools that allow pavement design engineers to be certain of the variables that must be modified to ensure that the structural model meets deflection requirements at the edge, corner, and interior of the concrete slab.\\n\\n\\n\\n The purpose of this project is to design and build a magnetic separation equipment, starting from the selection of the prototype to establishing the foundations of the previously established design. The main criteria that must be taken into account to be incorporated in any design and construction of a magnetic concentrator are identified and analyzed. The analysis of the physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of the sludge produced under a biological domestic wastewater treatment system is presented, specifically of activated sludge with extended aeration for a plant that treats a flow of 103 m3 / h. The sludge generated in the Paipa Wastewater Treatment Plant was classified according to the concentrations of heavy metals and pathogens present, in accordance with current international regulations, and the different alternatives for use or final disposal were analyzed, supported by Colombian preliminary regulations. and international standards, it also includes the analysis of the final disposal without any intention of recycling or recovery, such as the sanitary landfill and incineration, together with the evaluation of the different alternatives to propose the most viable solution from the point from an environmental, health, economic and social perspective. The conformation of trilayers of ceramic coatings of the SiO2-TiO2-ZrO2 system is shown, synthesized by the Sol-gel method, using Si (OC2H5) 4, Ti (OBu) 4 and Zr (OC3H7) 4 as precursors, as EtOH and water, and as a complexing agent 2,4 pentanedione. The ceramic coatings were deposited on AISI / SAE 304 stainless steel substrates using the dip-coating technique. The influence of the coatings on the anticorrosive behavior of the substrate in a 3% HCl solution was studied using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques and potentiodynamic polarization curves. Additionally, a morphological study was performed using the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technique. The values of the electrochemical parameters were found to change substantially with the concentration of the precursors added to the effects of the film on the substrate. The sensitivity analysis of each of the variables that influence the calculation of the warping stresses produced by the temperature difference of the faces of the hydraulic concrete slab is presented. The variables analyzed were: the modulus of elasticity of the concrete, the coefficient of expansion of the concrete, the temperature difference between the faces of the slab, the thickness of the concrete slab, the Poisson\\'s ratio of the concrete, the modulus of reaction of the slab support, the length of the slab and the width of the concrete slab. Through the sensitivity analysis it is possible to define the degree of importance of the variables and identify the most sensitive ones, or those that affect to a greater or lesser degree the mechanical behavior of concrete slabs due to the effect of temperature changes, in order to have tools that allow pavement design engineers to be certain of the variables that must be modified to ensure that the structural model meets the design requirements and ensures good mechanical behavior of the slab throughout its service life.\n"
